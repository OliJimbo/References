abstract = {{Psychological science aims to make the abstract measurable and quantifiable. As psychologists it is our challenge and charge to capture complex abstractions (e.g., authoritarianism, prejudice, depression) accurately and with transparency. But recent concerns have been raised about the proliferation of constructs across psychology sub‐disciplines, with construct redundancy now rife. Critics charge that we do not take seriously construct validity, especially discriminant validity, which exacerbates the replication crisis. Here the author outlines the problem and discusses at a conceptual level how latent modeling can aptly capture constructs and their interrelations without error, isolating and helping to circumvent construct validity problems. At the core of the issue lies a mathematical reality that seems to be largely ignored in psychology: if correlations within and between indicators of constructs are roughly comparable, their latent factors will correlate near‐perfectly and thus be redundant. Thoughts about how the field arrived at this juncture are discussed, along with a recommendation to avoid using cute labels (e.g., jingle‐jangle fallacies) to represent very serious problems (better labeled as construct redundancy fallacies). Recommendations for thinking straight about constructs, their validation, and their uniqueness, are offered.}},

abstract = {{ABSTRACT Purpose This study aimed to implement an aggregation method in Matlab for generating ActiGraph counts from raw acceleration recorded with an alternative accelerometer device and to investigate the validity of the method. Methods The aggregation method, including the frequency band-pass filter, was implemented and optimized based on standardized sinusoidal acceleration signals generated in Matlab and processed in the ActiLife software. Evaluating the validity of the aggregation method was approached using a mechanical setup and with a 24-h free-living recording using a convenient sample of nine subjects. Counts generated with the aggregation method applied to Axivity AX3 raw acceleration data were compared with counts generated with ActiLife from ActiGraph GT3X\&plus; data. Results An optimal band-pass filter was fitted resulting in a root-mean-square error of 25.7 counts per 10 s and mean absolute error of 15.0 counts per second across the full frequency range. The mechanical evaluation of the proposed aggregation method resulted in an absolute mean ± SD difference of −0.11 ± 0.97 counts per 10 s across all rotational frequencies compared with the original ActiGraph method. Applying the aggregation method to the 24-h free-living recordings resulted in an epoch level bias ranging from −16.2 to 0.9 counts per 10 s, a relative difference in the averaged physical activity (counts per minute) ranging from −0.5\&percnt; to 4.7\&percnt; with a group mean ± SD of 2.2\&percnt; ± 1.7\&percnt;, and a Cohen’s kappa of 0.945, indicating almost a perfect agreement in the intensity classification. Conclusion The proposed band-pass filter and aggregation method is highly valid for generating ActiGraph counts from raw acceleration data recorded with alternative devices. It would facilitate comparability between studies using different devices collecting raw acceleration data.}},

abstract = {{This review re‐examines the use of accelerometer and oxygen uptake data for the assessment of activity intensity. Accelerometers capture mechanical work, while oxygen uptake captures the energy cost of this work. Frequency filtering needs to be considered when processing acceleration data. A too restrictive filter attenuates the acceleration signal for walking and, to a higher degree, for running. This measurement error affects shorter (children) more than taller (adults) individuals due to their higher movement frequency. Less restrictive filtering includes more movement‐related signals and provides measures that better capture mechanical work, but may include more noise. An optimal filter cut‐point is determined where most relevant acceleration signals are included. Further, accelerometer placement affects what part of mechanical work being captured. While the waist placement captures total mechanical work and therefore contributes to measures of activity intensity equivalent by age and stature, the thigh and wrist placements capture more internal work and do not provide equivalent measures. Value calibration of accelerometer measures is usually performed using measured oxygen uptake with the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) as reference measure of activity intensity. However, the use of MET is not stringent and is not a measure of activity intensity equivalent by age and stature. A candidate measure is the mass‐specific net oxygen uptake, VO2net (VO2tot − VO2stand). To improve measurement of physical activity intensity using accelerometers, research developments are suggested concerning the processing of accelerometer data, use of energy expenditure as reference for activity intensity, and calibration procedure with absolute versus relative intensity.}},

Our goal was to record and chart the children's social engagement - measured using interpersonal movement synchrony - as they took part in a theatrical workshop that was specifically designed to enhance their social skills. Interpersonal synchrony, an important factor of social engagement that is known to be impaired in autism, is calculated using a cross-wavelet similarity comparison between participants' movement data. We evaluate the feasibility of the approach over 3 live performances, each lasting 2 hours, using 6 actors and a total of 10 autistic children. We show that by visualising each child's engagement over the course of a performance, it is possible to highlight subtle moments of social coordination that might otherwise be lost when reviewing video footage alone. This is important because it points the way to a new method for people who work with autistic children to be able to monitor the development of those in their care, and to adapt their therapeutic activities accordingly.}},

Originally studied by developmental psychologists, synchrony has now captured the interest of researchers in such fields as social signal processing, robotics, and machine learning. This paper emphasizes the current questions asked by synchrony evaluation and the state-of-the-art related methods. First, we present definitions and functions of synchrony in youth and adulthood. Next, we review the noncomputational and computational approaches of annotating, evaluating, and modeling interactional synchrony. Finally, the current limitations and future research directions in the fields of developmental robotics, social robotics, and clinical studies are discussed.}},

Multivariate synchrony goes beyond the bivariate case and can be useful for quantifying how groups, teams, and families coordinate their behaviors, or estimating the degree to which multiple modalities from an individual become synchronized. Our package includes state-of-the-art multivariate methods including symbolic entropy, multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis, coherence (with an additional sum-normalized modification), the cluster-phase ‘Rho’ metric, and a statistical test based on the Kuramoto order parameter. We also include functions for two surrogation techniques to compare the observed coordination dynamics with chance levels and a windowing function to examine time-varying coordination for most of the measures. Taken together, our collation and presentation of these methods make the study of interpersonal synchronization and coordination dynamics applicable to larger, more complex and often more ecologically valid study designs. In this work, we summarize the relevant theoretical background and present illustrative practical examples, lessons learned, as well as guidance for the usage of our package – using synthetic as well as empirical data. Furthermore, we provide a discussion of our work and software and outline interesting further directions and perspectives. multiSyncPy is freely available under the LGPL license at: https://github.com/cslab-hub/multiSyncPy, and also available at the Python package index.}},

	abstract = {The published literature has produced several definitions for the sense of presence in a simulated environment, as well as various methods for measuring it. The variety of conceptualizations makes it difficult for researchers to interpret, compare, and evaluate the presence ratings obtained from individual studies. Presence has been measured by employing questionnaires, physiological indices, behavioral feedbacks, and interviews. A systematic literature review was conducted to provide insight into the definitions and measurements of presence in studies from 2002 to 2019, with a focus on questionnaires and physiological measures. The review showed that scholars had introduced various definitions of presence that often originate from different theoretical standpoints and that this has produced a multitude of different questionnaires that aim to measure presence. At the same time, physiological studies that investigate the physiological correlates of the sense of presence have often shown ambiguous results or have not been replicated. Most of the scholars have preferred the use of questionnaires, with Witmer and Singer's Presence Questionnaire being the most prevalent. Among the physiological measures, electroencephalography was the most frequently used. The conclusions of the present review aim to stimulate future structured efforts to standardize the use of the construct of presence, as well as inspire the replication of the findings reported in the published literature.},

	abstract = {Current design of virtual reality (VR) applications relies essentially on the transposition of users' viewpoint in first-person perspective (1PP). Within this context, our research aims to compare the impact and the potentialities enabled via the integration of the third-person perspective (3PP) in immersive virtual environments (IVE). Our empirical study is conducted in order to assess the sense of presence, the sense of embodiment, and performance of users confronted with a series of tasks presenting a case of potential use for the video game industry. Our results do not reveal significant differences concerning the sense of spatial presence with either point of view. Nonetheless, they provide evidence confirming the relevance of using the first-person perspective to induce a sense of embodiment toward a virtual body, especially in terms of self-location and ownership. However, no significant differences were observed concerning the sense of agency. Concerning users' performance, our results demonstrate that the first-person perspective enables more accurate interactions, while the third-person perspective provides better space awareness.},

Customizing avatars in role playing games encourage intrinsic motivation in the learning process because of self-representation. Proteus Effect research suggests that the representations people make are an adaption of their actual/ ideal self and dictate how one conforms to the expectations and identity cues of their avatar. Objective/Purpose: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a digital gaming intervention aimed at increasing HPV risk perceptions, self- efficacy and behavioral intention to receive the HPV vaccine among college age men (18 - 26).Methods. This randomized control trial employed a 2 X 2 fully-crossed between subjects and tested the effects of avatar characters (assigned/customized) and perception of self (ideal/actual) on HPV risk perception, HPV vaccine self-efficacy and behavioral intent to receive the HPV vaccine. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions.Results. A Factorial ANOVA with repeated measures and a between subjects? factor (split plot) was used to test for the differences between the means of the outcome variables. Despite having no main or interaction effect our analysis did report a significant main effect of using a pre-post design with the experiment as a stimulus.Discussion/Conclusion. For experimental data, customizing an avatar to look like one?s actual self increases risk perception for the HPV virus and self ? efficacy for the HPV vaccine whereas customizing an avatar to look like one?s ideal self increases one?s intent to receive the HPV vaccine.},

@article{grassini2020,
	abstract = {The published literature has produced several definitions for the sense of presence in a simulated environment, as well as various methods for measuring it. The variety of conceptualizations makes it difficult for researchers to interpret, compare, and evaluate the presence ratings obtained from individual studies. Presence has been measured by employing questionnaires, physiological indices, behavioral feedbacks, and interviews. A systematic literature review was conducted to provide insight into the definitions and measurements of presence in studies from 2002 to 2019, with a focus on questionnaires and physiological measures. The review showed that scholars had introduced various definitions of presence that often originate from different theoretical standpoints and that this has produced a multitude of different questionnaires that aim to measure presence. At the same time, physiological studies that investigate the physiological correlates of the sense of presence have often shown ambiguous results or have not been replicated. Most of the scholars have preferred the use of questionnaires, with Witmer and Singer's Presence Questionnaire being the most prevalent. Among the physiological measures, electroencephalography was the most frequently used. The conclusions of the present review aim to stimulate future structured efforts to standardize the use of the construct of presence, as well as inspire the replication of the findings reported in the published literature.},

	abstract = {Current design of virtual reality (VR) applications relies essentially on the transposition of users' viewpoint in first-person perspective (1PP). Within this context, our research aims to compare the impact and the potentialities enabled via the integration of the third-person perspective (3PP) in immersive virtual environments (IVE). Our empirical study is conducted in order to assess the sense of presence, the sense of embodiment, and performance of users confronted with a series of tasks presenting a case of potential use for the video game industry. Our results do not reveal significant differences concerning the sense of spatial presence with either point of view. Nonetheless, they provide evidence confirming the relevance of using the first-person perspective to induce a sense of embodiment toward a virtual body, especially in terms of self-location and ownership. However, no significant differences were observed concerning the sense of agency. Concerning users' performance, our results demonstrate that the first-person perspective enables more accurate interactions, while the third-person perspective provides better space awareness.},

Customizing avatars in role playing games encourage intrinsic motivation in the learning process because of self-representation. Proteus Effect research suggests that the representations people make are an adaption of their actual/ ideal self and dictate how one conforms to the expectations and identity cues of their avatar. Objective/Purpose: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a digital gaming intervention aimed at increasing HPV risk perceptions, self- efficacy and behavioral intention to receive the HPV vaccine among college age men (18 - 26).Methods. This randomized control trial employed a 2 X 2 fully-crossed between subjects and tested the effects of avatar characters (assigned/customized) and perception of self (ideal/actual) on HPV risk perception, HPV vaccine self-efficacy and behavioral intent to receive the HPV vaccine. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions.Results. A Factorial ANOVA with repeated measures and a between subjects? factor (split plot) was used to test for the differences between the means of the outcome variables. Despite having no main or interaction effect our analysis did report a significant main effect of using a pre-post design with the experiment as a stimulus.Discussion/Conclusion. For experimental data, customizing an avatar to look like one?s actual self increases risk perception for the HPV virus and self ? efficacy for the HPV vaccine whereas customizing an avatar to look like one?s ideal self increases one?s intent to receive the HPV vaccine.},

	abstract = {The success of Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) as an online research platform has come at a price: MTurk has suffered from slowing rates of population replenishment, and growing participant non-naivety. Recently, a number of alternative platforms have emerged, offering capabilities similar to MTurk but providing access to new and more na{\"\i}ve populations. After surveying several options, we empirically examined two such platforms, CrowdFlower (CF) and Prolific Academic (ProA). In two studies, we found that participants on both platforms were more na{\"\i}ve and less dishonest compared to MTurk participants. Across the three platforms, CF provided the best response rate, but CF participants failed more attention-check questions and did not reproduce known effects replicated on ProA and MTurk. Moreover, ProA participants produced data quality that was higher than CF's and comparable to MTurk's. ProA and CF participants were also much more diverse than participants from MTurk.},

Tools for the assessment of the quality of research studies tend to be specific to a particular research design (e.g. randomized controlled trials, or qualitative interviews). This makes it difficult to assess the quality of a body of research that addresses the same or a similar research question but using different approaches. The aim of this paper is to describe the development and preliminary evaluation of a quality assessment tool that can be applied to a methodologically diverse set of research articles. Methods? The 16-item quality assessment tool (QATSDD) was assessed to determine its reliability and validity when used by health services researchers in the disciplines of psychology, sociology and nursing. Qualitative feedback was also gathered from mixed-methods health researchers regarding the comprehension, content, perceived value and usability of the tool. Results? Reference to existing widely used quality assessment tools and experts in systematic review confirmed that the components of the tool represented the construct of ?good research technique? being assessed. Face validity was subsequently established through feedback from a sample of nine health researchers. Inter-rater reliability was established through substantial agreement between three reviewers when applying the tool to a set of three research papers (??=?71.5{\%}), and good to substantial agreement between their scores at time 1 and after a 6-week interval at time 2 confirmed test?retest reliability. Conclusions? The QATSDD shows good reliability and validity for use in the quality assessment of a diversity of studies, and may be an extremely useful tool for reviewers to standardize and increase the rigour of their assessments in reviews of the published papers which include qualitative and quantitative work.},

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of active BC interventions designed to promote physical activity and healthy eating and investigate whether theoretically specified BC techniques improve outcome. Design: Interventions, evaluated in experimental or quasi-experimental studies, using behavioral and/or cognitive techniques to increase physical activity and healthy eating in adults, were systematically reviewed. Intervention content was reliably classified into 26 BC techniques and the effects of individual techniques, and of a theoretically derived combination of self-regulation techniques, were assessed using meta-regression. Main Outcome Measures: Valid outcomes of physical activity and healthy eating. Results: The 122 evaluations (N = 44,747) produced an overall pooled effect size of 0.31 (95% confidence interval = 0.26 to 0.36, I2 = 69%). Th},

We propose to reposition the object of this type of measure, namely a mental attribute as measured by mental tests. Mental attributes should be considered not as a true object independent of the knower, but as an emergent property of a person dependent on the social context. On the basis of this clarified ontology, we consider that an empirical approach to measuring a mental attribute is possible. This approach must be resolutely pragmatist and realist. In practical terms, this means that a test needs to be renegotiated relative to the context. The validation of quantitative measures requires verification of a certain number of criteria. Consequently, our work critically explores measures as they are usually implemented in the area of psychometrics.},

@article{MAUL2016311,
	abstract = {Measurement has played a central role in the development of the physical sciences and engineering, and is considered by many to be a privileged method for acquiring information about the world. It is thus unsurprising that the psychological sciences have also attempted to develop methods for measurement. However, it is not clear how the ways in which psychological scientists understand measurement accord with how the concept is understood in other scientific disciplines, or by the professional and general publics. In part this may be due to the ways in which several distinct strands of thinking about scientific inquiry (and measurement in particular) have influenced the work of psychological scientists over roughly the past hundred years. Given that such influences are often not studied or even acknowledged, many psychological scientists may be unaware of the resulting tensions in their conceptual vocabulary, and of the gaps between the nature of their claims on psychological measurement and the substantiation for those claims. The aim of this paper is to overview the major philosophical influences on thinking about psychological measurement, and to note the pitfalls of some of the extreme positions that have emerged. We hope that such an overview may help facilitate greater clarity concerning the semantics of measurement claims made by psychological scientists.},

  abstract      = {The obesity epidemic is a significant issue for health and social policy, with major ramifications for economic productivity across the globe. In Western industrialized countries, however, it impacts on the population along traditional lines of economic disadvantage, its incidence being inversely related to income and education. As a health issue and matter for policy intervention, obesity is frequently presented in public discourse within an existing moral framework which links illness with moral failure. This is reminiscent of the historical treatment of poverty. It will be argued in this paper that the convergence of moralized discourses around poverty and illness is represented most visibly and powerfully in the issue of obesity, resulting in policy which addresses these moral `shortcomings' at the expense of attention to the structures which create ill health and poverty. An alternative social-structural perspective will be proposed as a potentially more helpful frame for addressing the obesity issue.},

Two studies were conducted to test the relations between VSDs (i.e., idealized vs utopian avatar), avatar identification, and gaming addiction. In the cross-sectional survey (Study 1; 770 MMORPGs players) we assumed that higher MMORPG addiction was directly predicted by the construction of an idealized avatar (vs. utopian avatar) and by the avatar identification, which also mediated the relationship between the VSDs and gaming addiction. In the 2 × 2 experimental study (Study 2; 100 participants), manipulating VSD and avatar identification, we assumed that MMORPG addiction risk was higher in the idealized avatar-high identification condition than in the utopian avatar-low identification condition. Results confirmed that the more idealized the avatar was, the more the users increased their avatar identification (Study 1), that in turn was associated with gaming addiction (Study 1 and Study 2), and that only an idealized avatar (vs. utopian avatar) directly affected gaming addiction (Study 1). Furthermore, results showed that MMORPG addiction risk was higher in participants who customized an idealized avatar and identified with it (vs. utopian avatar-low identification) (Study 2).},

Ss were asked to list up to 10 attributes each for their actual self, their ideal self (their own or others' hopes and goals for them), and their ought self (their own or others' beliefs about their duty and obligations). In Study 1, Ss asked to imagine a positive or negative event who had a predominant actual--ideal discrepancy felt more dejected on a mood measure and wrote more slowly on a writing-speed task in the negative event condition than in the positive event condition.

@article{Thompson:1995aa,
	abstract = {The present inquiry examines the psychosocial meanings and processes that shape consumers' sense of body image and the consumption behaviors motivated by those perceptions. Poststructuralist interpretive procedures were used to analyze interviews with 30 male and female consumers, aged 6-54. This discourse analysis led to the development of three process-orientated themes: (1) the ideology of self-control, (2) the social processes of normalization and problematization, and (3) the operation of the disciplinary gaze The systematic manifestations of these themes are illustrated across a range of consumer experiences and body-focused perceptions. Implications of these themes for the theoretical conceptualizations of body image and the nature of self-concept in contemporary consumer culture are discussed.},

	abstract = {This study examined the relationship between offline personality and avatar customisation in Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) players, and questioned whether the offline personality is always the starting point for the customisation of an avatar. The aims were: to analyse the discrepancy profiles which emerge when players are asked to rate their primary avatar, actual self and ideal self with respect to certain personality factors; to explore whether these profiles varied across personality factors and within players; and to analyse the relation between discrepancy profiles and the extent to which players identified with their avatars. A sample of 845 MMORPG players completed an online questionnaire consisting of a short version of the Big Five Personality Inventory and an avatar identification scale. Four discrepancy profiles (idealised, actualised, alter ego, negative hero) common to the personality factors extroversion, consciousness, agreeableness and emotional stability and stable within players emerged. They converged into four kind of offline personality-avatar relationship differently related with avatar identification that was higher when avatar was similar to self or an extension of self, and lower when avatar was other than self, or antithesis of self. The practical implication of these finding are discussed.},

Player identification is one of the outcomes of gameplay experiences in these worlds and has been shown to affect enjoyment and reduce self-discrepancy. Avatar-based customization has potential to impact player identification by shaping the relationship between the player and the character. This mixed method study aims to fill the gap in the identification literature by examining the effects of avatar-based customization on players' identification with and empathy towards their characters in a massively multiplayer online game, Lord of the Rings Online (LotRO). Participants (N = 66) played LotRO either in customization or in no-customization groups for about ten hours in four sessions over two weeks in a controlled lab setting. Data were collected through interviews, surveys and observations. Results showed both time and avatar-based customization positively impacted players' identification with their avatars. Self-Determination Theory is used to interpret results.},

	abstract = {Fostering intrinsic motivation with interactive applications can increase the enjoyment that people experience when using technology, but can also translate into more invested effort. We propose that identifying with an avatar in a game will increase the intrinsic motivation of the player. We analyzed data from 126 participants playing a custom endless runner game and show that similarity identification, embodied identification, and wishful identification increases autonomy, immersion, invested effort, enjoyment, and positive affect. We also show that greater identification translates into motivated behaviour as operationalized by the time that players spent in an unending version of the infinite runner. Important for the design of games for entertainment and serious purposes, we discuss how identification with an avatar can be facilitated to cultivate intrinsic motivation within and beyond games.},

Customizing avatars in role playing games encourage intrinsic motivation in the learning process because of self-representation. Proteus Effect research suggests that the representations people make are an adaption of their actual/ ideal self and dictate how one conforms to the expectations and identity cues of their avatar. Objective/Purpose: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a digital gaming intervention aimed at increasing HPV risk perceptions, self- efficacy and behavioral intention to receive the HPV vaccine among college age men (18 - 26).Methods. This randomized control trial employed a 2 X 2 fully-crossed between subjects and tested the effects of avatar characters (assigned/customized) and perception of self (ideal/actual) on HPV risk perception, HPV vaccine self-efficacy and behavioral intent to receive the HPV vaccine. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions.Results. A Factorial ANOVA with repeated measures and a between subjects? factor (split plot) was used to test for the differences between the means of the outcome variables. Despite having no main or interaction effect our analysis did report a significant main effect of using a pre-post design with the experiment as a stimulus.Discussion/Conclusion. For experimental data, customizing an avatar to look like one?s actual self increases risk perception for the HPV virus and self ? efficacy for the HPV vaccine whereas customizing an avatar to look like one?s ideal self increases one?s intent to receive the HPV vaccine.},

	abstract = {Claims about `empowerment' increasingly animate debates about the `sexualization of culture'. This article responds to Lamb and Peterson's (2011) attempts to open up and complicate the notion of `sexual empowerment' as it is used in relation to adolescent girls. Drawing on contemporary research from the UK, New Zealand and elsewhere, the article seeks to promote a dialogue between media and communications research and more psychologically oriented scholarship. The paper makes four arguments. First it points to the need to rethink conceptualizations of the media, and processes of media influence. Secondly it raises critical questions about the notion of `media literacy' which has increasingly taken on the status of panacea in debates about young people and `sexualization'. Thirdly it highlights the curious absence of considerations of power in debates about sexual empowerment, and argues for the need to think about sexualization in relation to class, `race', sexuality and other axes of oppression. Finally, it raises critical questions about the utility of the notion of sexual empowerment, given its individualistic framing, the developmentalism implicit in its use, and the difficulties in identifying it in cultures in which `empowerment' is used to sell everything from liquid detergents to breast augmentation surgery.},

Since its inception, the construct has been associated with a variety of exercise-related constructs including perceived competence, self-consciousness, and the exercise milieu individuals choose. The present purpose was to relate social physique anxiety to participants' attitudes toward exercise, adherence behaviors, participation motivation, personality variables, and emotional attitude toward exercise. 326 university fitness-center participants were surveyed and asked for demographic information, to self-report their exercise habits, and to answer questions measuring the construct, motivation, personality, and attitudes toward exercise. Women had higher scores on the Social Physique Anxiety Scale than men; individuals who scored high were more likely to endorse extrinsic motives for exercise than individuals scoring low on the scale, and high scores were indicative of higher public body awareness. Individuals with high scores on the Social Physique Anxiety Scale exhibited an emotional profile similar to addicted exercisers. Given these results, implications for alleviation of such anxiety were discussed.},

	abstract = {Objective To examine whether playing exergames improves physical fitness in young adults; and whether such an improvement depends on their previous participation in other forms of exercise. Design, setting, and participants This study was a randomized controlled trial, which enrolled 117 college students from January to April 2014, who were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 55) or a control group (n = 62). Among them, 113 (96.6%) completed participation in this study. Intervention The 12-week exergame program included the use of exergames for 30 min, three times a week, and an examination of physical fitness before and after the program. Results Exergames improved normalized diastolic blood pressure, sit-up tests and 3-min step tests, but increased body fat percentage. In addition to the main effects, for participants who had previously engaged in other forms of exercise of 120 min or more per week, playing exergames improved performance in normalized diastolic blood pressure, sit-up tests, push-ups, and 3-min step tests. For participants previously engaging in other forms of exercise of less than 120 min per week, playing exergames improved performance in sit-up tests, and response time. Conclusions Using exergames may improve physical fitness among young adults.},

	abstract = {Background No study has yet adopted the perspective of the self-categorization theory to examine the impact of playing exergames on players' attitudes and intentions towards other forms of exercise. Purpose To examine the impact of playing exergames on players' attitudes and intentions to engage in other exercise and how such an impact depends on previous exercise frequency. Methods This randomized controlled trial recruited 117 college students who were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (n = 55) or a control group (n = 62). Participants in the first group played an exergame for 30 min, three times per week for 12 weeks. This study calculated the changes in the participants' attitudes and intentions before and after the program, and compared the differences between the two groups. Results Exergaming improved the players' attitudes toward other forms of exercise. Such improvement was significant for frequent exercisers, but not for infrequent exercisers. Surprisingly, playing exergames strengthened the intentions to engage in other forms of exercise for frequent exercisers, but weakened such intentions for infrequent exercisers. Conclusions Exergaming encourages frequent exercisers to engage in other forms of exercise, but does the opposite among infrequent exercisers. Originality This study is the first identifying the contingent effect of exergaming on users' attitudes and intentions toward other forms of exercise.},

@article{Christensen:2013aa,
	abstract = {Introduction Men who have sex with men (MSM) often face socially sanctioned disapproval of sexual deviance from the heterosexual ``normal.'' Such sexual stigma can be internalized producing a painful affective state (i.e., shame). Although shame (e.g., addiction) can predict risk-taking (e.g., alcohol abuse), sexual shame's link to sexual risk-taking is unclear. Socially Optimized Learning in Virtual Environments (SOLVE) was designed to reduce MSM's sexual shame, but whether it does so, and if that reduction predicts HIV risk reduction, is unclear. To test if at baseline, MSM's reported past unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) is related to shame; MSM's exposure to SOLVE compared to a wait-list control (WLC) condition reduces MSM's shame; and shame-reduction mediates the link between WLC condition and UAI risk reduction. Methods HIV-negative, self-identified African American, Latino or White MSM, aged 18--24 years, who had had UAI with a non-primary/casual partner in the past three months were recruited for a national online study. Eligible MSM were computer randomized to either WLC or a web-delivered SOLVE. Retained MSM completed baseline measures (e.g., UAI in the past three months; current level of shame) and, in the SOLVE group, viewed at least one level of the game. At the end of the first session, shame was measured again. MSM completed follow-up UAI measures three months later. All data from 921 retained MSM (WLC condition, 484; SOLVE condition, 437) were analyzed, with missing data multiply imputed. Results At baseline, MSM reporting more risky sexual behaviour reported more shame (r s=0.21; p<0.001). MSM in the SOLVE intervention reported more shame reduction (M=−0.08) than MSM in the control condition (M=0.07; t(919)=4.24; p<0.001). As predicted, the indirect effect was significant (point estimate −0.10, 95% bias-corrected CI [−0.01 to −0.23] such that participants in the SOLVE treatment condition reported greater reductions in shame, which in turn predicted reductions in risky sexual behaviour at follow-up. The direct effect, however, was not significant.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTIn this paper we present an analysis of the character creation interface on the Nintendo WiiU and explore the pragmatics of avatar customisation through a between-subjects, qualitative user study involving 24 participants. Our Mii research ? or ?Miisearch? ? is motivated by our desire to highlight the agency these interfaces have in self-representational practices; specifically, to understand the effects of interface affordances on avatar customisation in games. Furthermore, as self-representational practices are often studied using distance methods and self-reporting (e.g. surveys), we compare data on avatar customisation from two sources: a survey and participant observation via micro-ethnography. Results of our study reveal discrepancies between the survey data and participant observation, challenging popular methodological approaches in both the game studies and HCI communities. Most significantly, our findings illustrate the combined effects of gaming contexts and interface affordances on avatar customisation.},

	abstract = {Figural drawing scales are commonly used to measure aspects of body image disturbance. There are several advantages to figural drawing scales including ease and flexibility in administration. Given the wide variety of scales available, it is important that researchers and clinicians choose the most useful and appropriate scale. This review includes all known existing paper and pencil figural drawing scales with published reliability and validity data. Scales that required a computer interface or specialized equipment or that measured only specific body regions were omitted. In addition to the reliability and validity results, the review specifies each scale's components; namely, the number of figural drawings, gender(s) represented, clothing/body detail represented, appropriate ages, basis of the drawings, scale type (figural, silhouette, or pictorial), and availability of body size distortion measurements. Potential methodological shortcomings are addressed including procedural issues in administration. Recommendations for selecting an appropriate figural drawing scale are included and alternatives to figural drawing scales are discussed.},

	abstract = {This study experimentally examined the impact of exposure to fitspiration images and self-compassion quotes on social media on young women's body satisfaction, body appreciation, self-compassion, and negative mood. Female undergraduate students (N=160) were randomly assigned to view either Instagram images of fitspiration, self-compassion quotes, a combination of both, or appearance-neutral images. Results showed no differences between viewing fitspiration images compared to viewing neutral images, except for poorer self-compassion among those who viewed fitspiration images. However, women who viewed self-compassion quotes showed greater body satisfaction, body appreciation, self-compassion, and reduced negative mood compared to women who viewed neutral images. Further, viewing a combination of fitspiration images and self-compassion quotes led to positive outcomes compared to viewing only fitspiration images. Trait levels of thin-ideal internalisation moderated some effects. The findings suggest that self-compassion might offer a novel avenue for attenuating the negative impact of social media on women's body satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Fitspiration is an online trend designed to inspire viewers towards a healthier lifestyle by promoting exercise and healthy food. The present study aimed to experimentally investigate the impact of fitspiration images on women's body image. Participants were 130 female undergraduate students who were randomly assigned to view either a set of Instagram fitspiration images or a control set of travel images presented on an iPad. Results showed that acute exposure to fitspiration images led to increased negative mood and body dissatisfaction and decreased state appearance self-esteem relative to travel images. Importantly, regression analyses showed that the effects of image type were mediated by state appearance comparison. Thus it was concluded that fitspiration can have negative unintended consequences for body image. The results offer support to general sociocultural models of media effects on body image, and extend these to ``new''media.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have documented a shift in the cultural ideal of physical attractiveness, with women subscribing to a visibly toned ideal that emphasises health and fitness. The present study experimentally investigated the impact of athletic and muscular fitness-idealised images compared to traditional thin ideal images on women's body dissatisfaction and exercise behaviour, under the framework of Social Comparison Theory. Participants were 106 female undergraduate students randomly assigned to view one of three sets of images (thin ideal, athletic ideal, or muscular ideal) followed by a bout of exercise. Acute exposure to athletic ideal and thin ideal images led to increased body dissatisfaction, but exposure to muscular ideal images did not. Relative to thin ideal images, fitness-idealised images did not motivate participants to engage in higher levels of exercise suggesting that this type of fitness inspiration might not motivate actual exercise behaviour.},

	abstract = {Modern ideals of female attractiveness include an extremely toned and fit appearance in addition to extreme thinness. Although viewing thin models has a negative effect on women's body image, research has not tested the effect of exposure to the ultra-fit physique separate from the thin-ideal. This randomized, posttest-only experiment tested the effects of the athletic aspect of the current ideal by exposing 138 undergraduate women to thin and athletic models, normal weight athletic models, or a control condition consisting of neutral objects. The study also tested the moderating effects of thin-ideal and athletic-ideal internalization. Exposure to thin ultra-fit models, but not normal weight ultra-fit models, produced an increase in body dissatisfaction and neither internalization variable moderated this effect. Findings suggest that interventions that focus on the benefits of fitness while challenging the desirability of thinness may offer promising results.},

	abstract = {``Fitspiration'' websites are media that aim to inspire people to live healthy and fit lifestyles through motivating images and text related to exercise and diet. Given the link between similar Internet content (i.e., healthy living blogs) and problematic messages, we hypothesized that content on these sites would over-emphasize appearance and promote problematic messages regarding exercise and diet. Keywords ``fitspo'' and ``fitspiration'' were entered into search engines. The first 10 images and text from 51 individual websites were rated on a variety of characteristics. Results indicated that a majority of messages found on fitspiration websites focused on appearance. Other common themes included content promoting exercise for appearance-motivated reasons and content promoting dietary restraint. ``Fitspiration'' websites are a source of messages that reinforce over-valuation of physical appearance, eating concerns, and excessive exercise. Further research is needed to examine the impact viewing such content has on participants' psychological health.},

	abstract = {The current study was conducted to determine if electronic gaming among males is related to body image, formation of body ideals, and appraisals of female attractiveness. A sample of 219 college-aged men (age 18--32) completed a variety of measures that assessed their game play habits, their perceptions of their own attractiveness, and perceptions of women's attractiveness. Results indicated that participants' ratings of women's attractiveness varied across the genres of game most frequently played but was not related to age of commencement or frequency of electronic game play. Additionally, frequency of play and age of commencement of game play were not related to self-perceptions of physical attractiveness, the association of positive attributes with muscularity, or the drive to become more muscular. Men's appearance satisfaction and valuation of muscularity was related to the extent to which they compare their own appearance to that of the characters featured in their electronic games. The results indicate that, unlike other forms of media, electronic gaming may have a weaker relationship to decreased appearance satisfaction or the formation of unrealistic standards of attractiveness.},

In this report we use Monte-Carlo simulations to determine the critical sample size from which on the magnitude of a correlation can be expected to be stable. The necessary sample size to achieve stable estimates for correlations depends on the effect size, the width of the corridor of stability (i.e., a corridor around the true value where deviations are tolerated), and the requested confidence that the trajectory does not leave this corridor any more. Results indicate that in typical scenarios the sample size should approach 250 for stable estimates.},

	abstract = {Despite decades of research documenting consistent stigma and discrimination against individuals with obesity, weight stigma is rarely considered in obesity prevention and treatment efforts. In recent years, evidence has examined weight stigmatization as a unique contributor to negative health outcomes and behaviors that can promote and exacerbate obesity. This review summarizes findings from published studies within the past 4 years examining the relationship between weight stigma and maladaptive eating behaviors (binge eating and increased food consumption), physical activity, weight status (weight gain and loss and development of obesity), and physiological stress responses. Research evaluating the effects of weight stigma present in obesity-related public health campaigns is also highlighted. Evidence collectively demonstrates negative implications of stigmatization for weight-related health correlates and behaviors and suggests that addressing weight stigma in obesity prevention and treatment is warranted. Key questions for future research to further delineate the health effects of weight stigmatization are summarized.},

@article{Daley2008,
	abstract = {There has been considerable research interest in the effects of exercise upon depression outcomes. Recently, health agencies in the United Kingdom (UK) and beyond have made several guidance statements on this issue. Therefore, this review seeks to provide a synthesis of evidence regarding the effectiveness of exercise in the management of depression (including postnatal depression) in adults. Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) and PsychINFO using relevant search terms. The article describes how meta-analyses from peer reviewed journals have reported exercise as treatment for depression is more effective than no treatment, as effective as traditional interventions in some instances, possibly a promising approach to postnatal depression and has equivalent adherence rates to medication. However, reviews have also raised concerns about the methodological quality of trials, possible overestimation of treatment effects and lack of data regarding long term benefits. Based on the available evidence it is concluded that while awaiting further high quality trial evidence it would seem appropriate for exercise to be recommended in combination with other treatments.},

What is known about this contemporary construct? This article situates and contextualizes positive body image within Cash's scholarship, eating disorder prevention efforts, feminist influences, strength-based disciplines within psychology, and Buddhism. Extracting insights from quantitative and qualitative research, this article demonstrates that positive body image is (a) distinct from negative body image; (b) multifaceted (including body appreciation, body acceptance/love, conceptualizing beauty broadly, adaptive investment in appearance, inner positivity, interpreting information in a body-protective manner); (c) holistic; (d) stable and malleable; (e) protective; (f) linked to self-perceived body acceptance by others; and (g) shaped by social identities. Complementing what positive body image is, this article further details what positive body image is not to provide a more nuanced understanding of this construct.},

	abstract = {We tested the effectiveness of exposure to two functionality-focused media campaigns, This Girl Can and #jointhemovement, in improving state appearance and physical functionality satisfaction, exercise intent, and protecting against exposure to idealised imagery. Across two studies, 339 (Mage=24.94, SD=4.98) and 256 (Mage=26.46, SD=5.50) women viewed the campaign or control video, followed by images of models who were posed or physically active, or images of landscapes. State satisfaction and exercise intent was measured at pre-test, post-video, post-images, and 1-week follow-up. Social comparison was measured at post-images. Viewing either campaign produced higher appearance satisfaction and exercise intentions than the control video. Effects weren't maintained after viewing idealised imagery or 1 week later. Further, the campaigns did not decrease social comparisons when viewing idealised imagery. Results can inform agencies about campaign effectiveness and suggest that women benefit from campaigns that feature non-idealised depictions of women exercising.},

	abstract = {This experiment compared the effects of aerobic-training (AT) versus strength-training (ST) on body image among young women with pre-existing body image concerns. Theory-based correlates of body image change were also examined. Participants were 46 women (M age=21.5 years), randomly assigned to an 8-week AT or ST intervention consisting of supervised exercise 3 days/week. Multidimensional measures of body image were administered pre- and post-intervention, along with measures of physical fitness, perceived fitness, and exercise self-efficacy. Women in the AT condition reported greater reductions in social physique anxiety (p=.001) and tended to report greater improvements in appearance evaluation (p=.06) than women in the ST condition. Changes in perceived fatness, perceived aerobic endurance and aerobic self-efficacy were significantly correlated with body image change (ps<.003). Results provide direction for prescribing exercise to improve body image and advancing theory to account for the effects of exercise.},

	abstract = {This article examines whether positive body image can protect women from negative media exposure effects. University women (N=112) were randomly allocated to view advertisements featuring ultra-thin models or control images. Women who reported high levels of body appreciation did not report negative media exposure effects. Furthermore, the protective role of body appreciation was also evident among women known to be vulnerable to media exposure. Women high on thin-ideal internalization and low on body appreciation reported appearance-discrepancies that were more salient and larger when they viewed models compared to the control group. However, women high on thin-ideal internalization and also high on body appreciation rated appearance-discrepancies as less important and no difference in size than the control group. The results support the notion that positive body image protects women from negative environmental appearance messages and suggests that promoting positive body image may be an effective intervention strategy.},

  abstract      = {Objective: Research on active videogames (AVGs) has demonstrated the motivation-boosting power of the K{\"o}hler effect (a motivating force for "weak links" in groups based on group principles of upward social comparison and indispensability) with software-generated partners (SGPs), but the effect has yet to be examined over time. We tested the viability of the K{\"o}hler effect in an AVG with an SGP over 12 exercise sessions using a cycle ergometer and whether a fatiguing partner (FP) could further boost the effect. Materials and methods: A repeated-measures design was used to assess mean changes in exercise persistence over time. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three game conditions: AVG alone (individual-control [IC]), AVG with a consistently superior partner (CSP), or AVG with a superior partner who showed signs of fatigue (FP). Assessments were conducted on 82 participants (42 college students and 40 adults from the community) in a laboratory over 12 experimental sessions. The main outcome measure was exercise persistence (minutes of gameplay cycling at 75% HRmax). Results: Data yielded significant improvements in exercise duration for men in the FP condition when compared with men in the IC condition (Mdiff = 12:32 minutes, SEdiff = 4:54). Women showed no change in exercise persistence over time and no condition differences. Conclusion: Exercising in an AVG with a superior SGP, who shows signs of fatigue over time, improved exercise persistence for men but not for women under present experimental conditions.},

	abstract = {Older adults are increasingly interacting with other people online via virtual avatars, yet little is known about how avatars affect older adults' behavior. This study examines how interacting avatars' age affects older adult's self-disclosure and trust in a relation-building context. Previous studies have found that users can take on behaviors consistent with characteristics of the avatars. In social interactions, people also assess their avatar in relation to other avatars for similarity or differences. We conducted a 2 (self-avatar: old vs. young) × 2 (other's avatar: old vs. young) experiment with older-adult participants aged 60+ (n = 95). The findings show that using younger avatars did not increase self-disclosure. However, the older-adult participants disclosed more information when their avatar's age matched their partner avatar's age (i.e., old to old, young to young). They also trust their partners more when the interacting avatars shared similar age. This study provides theoretical insights into the role of avatars in online relationship-building and extends our understanding of the avatar effects on older adults.},

The method assigns high scores not to the most common answers but to the answers that are more common than collectively predicted, with predictions drawn from the same population. This simple adjustment in the scoring criterion removes all bias in favor of consensus: Truthful answers maximize expected score even for respondents who believe that their answer represents a minority view.},

@article{aac4716,
	abstract = {One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P \&lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that {\textquotedblleft}we already know this{\textquotedblright} belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original. Density plots are separated by significant (blue) and nonsignificant (red) effects.Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown.

Using an anonymous elicitation format supplemented by incentives for honest reporting, we surveyed over 2,000 psychologists about their involvement in questionable research practices. The impact of truth-telling incentives on self-admissions of questionable research practices was positive, and this impact was greater for practices that respondents judged to be less defensible. Combining three different estimation methods, we found that the percentage of respondents who have engaged in questionable practices was surprisingly high. This finding suggests that some questionable practices may constitute the prevailing research norm.},

	abstract = {More Americans now play video games than go to the movies (NPD Group, 2009). The meteoric rise in popularity of video games highlights the need for research approaches that can deepen our scientific understanding of video game engagement. This article advances a theory-based motivational model for examining and evaluating the ways by which video game engagement shapes psychological processes and influences well-being. Rooted in self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000; Ryan & Deci, 2000a), our approach suggests that both the appeal and well-being effects of video games are based in their potential to satisfy basic psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. We review recent empirical evidence applying this perspective to a number of topics including need satisfaction in games and short-term well-being, the motivational appeal of violent game content, motivational sources of postplay aggression, the antecedents and consequences of disordered patterns of game engagement, and the determinants and effects of immersion. Implications of this model for the future study of game motivation and the use of video games in interventions are discussed.},

	abstract = {This study examines the effects of exposure to the muscular male body ideal on body-focused negative affect among male gym users and non-exercisers. As hypothesized, the impact of media exposure depended on men's exercise status. Non-exercisers (n=58) reported greater body-focused negative affect after exposure to images of muscular male models than after neutral images (no model controls), whereas gym users (n=58) showed a tendency for less body-focused negative affect after the model images than after the control images. Furthermore, the extent to which gym users were motivated to increase strength and muscularity moderated these exposure effects; men who reported stronger strength and muscularity exercise motivation reported a greater degree of self-enhancement after exposure to the muscular ideal. The findings are interpreted with respect to likely differences in motives for social comparisons.},

@article{Salci:2017aa,
	abstract = {The primary purpose of this study was to propose and test a mediation model of changes in physical self-efficacy, physical self-perceptions, and affect as mediators by which a single bout of exercise improves state body image. A secondary purpose was to identify how long improvements in state body image are sustained post-exercise. Sixty university-aged women (19.57 $\pm$1.37 y) with pre-existing body image concerns, and who exercised regularly, were randomized to perform 30 min of moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise or quiet reading. State body image, physical self-efficacy, physical self-perceptions and affect were assessed. Mediational analyses revealed self-perceptions of body fatness (95{\%} CI {$[$}0.03, 0.44{$]$}, κ2 = 0.13, abps = 0.20) and strength (95{\%} CI {$[$}0.15, 0.60{$]$}, κ2 = 0.23, abps = 0.33) mediated improvements in state body image which were sustained at least 20 min post-exercise. These results contribute to the development of a model explaining the effects of exercise on body image and practical recommendations for the use of exercise to improve body image.},

@article{Pila:2016aa,
	abstract = {Objectives This study tested the link between daily body-related upward social comparisons (BUSCs) and exercise behavior, and examined how appearance evaluation and gender may impact this association. Method In a weeklong assessment, 87 participants (54% women) completed daily retrospective measures of social comparisons and exercise behavior, and a one-time trait measure of appearance evaluation. Results Based on findings from hierarchical linear modeling, men with more negative appearance evaluations reported higher exercise engagement on days when they made more (compared to less) BUSCs. Meanwhile, women with more negative appearance evaluations reported less exercise engagement on days when they engaged in more (compared to less) BUSCs. Conclusions Among individuals who experience negative appearance evaluations, upward body comparisons are associated with more exercising among men, and lower exercise among women. BUSCs have an important role in promoting adaptive exercise behaviors and managing negative body image.},

  abstract      = {The purpose of this study was to qualitatively examine factors related to physical activity adherence to understand why women continue to participate in long-term exercise after completing a structured exercise program. Data were collected from focus groups, interviews, and e-mails, and analysis used grounded theory. The central category related to physical activity adherence was self-worth. Motivation, activity enjoyment, priorities, body image, ability to access support, and self-regulation skills had an impact on the self-worth of nonadherers and adherers. Women must value themselves enough to continue to participate in physical activity once they start. Exercise and fitness professionals are encouraged to use strategies to increase self-worth and long-term adherence to physical activity. Some recommended strategies include (a) increasing motivation and enjoyment relative to activity, (b) making activity a high priority in a woman's life, (c) improving or deemphasizing body image, (d) increasing a woman's ability to access support, and (e) facilitating the use of self-regulation strategies. This study is the first to examine qualitative perspectives of exercise adherence among women who completed a structured exercise program. Several concepts related to adherence presented in the quantitative literature are confirmed and enhanced in this study.},

	abstract = {Abstract Objectives Insufficient engagement in healthy eating and physical activity remains a major health concern, significantly contributing to mortality rates worldwide. This study investigated the barriers to, and the psychological factors surrounding, healthy eating and physical activity, as experienced by an under‐researched community sample. Methods A sample of 741 Australian adults completed an online survey, reporting their physical activity levels, current diet, knowledge of physical activity, and healthy eating recommendations, and the barriers encountered to these health behaviours. Participants also answered questions about self‐efficacy, locus of control, and outcome expectancies in regard to these health behaviours. Results Increased perception of barriers was found to be associated with decreased participation in both healthy eating and physical activity. Knowledge of nutrition recommendations predicted fruit and vegetable intake, while knowledge of physical activity recommendations did not predict activity levels. Higher self‐efficacy was found in those who engaged in recommended amounts of physical activity, but did not differ between fruit and vegetable consumption groups. Conclusions Perceived barriers to healthy eating and physical activity affect participation in health behaviours across the population. Negative beliefs surrounding time, cost, effort, and expected outcomes, as well as procedural knowledge to carry out health behaviours, need to be addressed to facilitate health behaviours. Implications These findings are relevant to inform health promotion and lifestyle interventions to better equip individuals with the information and skills required to overcome the barriers preventing these health behaviours.},

	abstract = {Body size satisfaction may be an important factor associated with physical activity. We analyzed data from the 2002 National Physical Activity and Weight Loss Survey (NPAWLS), a population‐based cross‐sectional telephone survey of US adults. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association of body size satisfaction on being regularly active. Participants were aged ≥18 years with complete data on weight, race/ethnicity, physical activity level, and body size satisfaction (n = 10,021). More than half of men (55.8\%) and women (53.3\%) who reported being very satisfied with the body size were regularly active. After adjustment for covariates, participants who reported being somewhat or not satisfied with their body size had a 13 and 44\% lower odds of being regularly active, respectively, compared with those very satisfied with their body size. When stratified by race/ethnicity, this association remained in whites (P for trend <0.001), but became weaker and nonsignificant in blacks, Hispanics, or other racial/ethnic groups. Irrespective of actual weight, those who were satisfied with their body size were more likely to engage in regular physical activity than those less satisfied. Further research is needed to explore predictors of physical activity to reduce health disparities.},

A survey was conducted through the random sampling of a large population. The NE‐N group reported using the same amount of imagery as the other 2 groups. NE‐N participants were the least and RE participants the most self‐determined, with NE‐I participants in between. The patterns of association among imagery and self‐determination were different for the NE‐N participants than the other 2 groups. It was concluded that imagery interventions that might be successful with RE and NE‐I participants are unlikely to be effective with NE‐N participants.},

@article{Suh:2011aa,
	abstract = {As broadband Internet access and virtual reality technology rapidly expand, virtual worlds and three-dimensional avatars will become more pervasive and widely adopted. In virtual worlds, people assume an identity as an avatar and interact with each other. The objective of this study is to theorize how users form attitudes and intentions regarding avatars in realistic, task-focused virtual world settings. To investigate these effects, this study proposes a conceptual framework based on dual-congruity perspectives (self-congruity and functional congruity). The results show that the more closely an avatar resembles its user, the more the user is likely to have positive attitudes (e.g., affection, connection, and passion) toward the avatar, and the better able to evaluate the quality and performance of apparel products. In the end, these positive attitudes toward an avatar and its usefulness positively affect users' intentions to use the avatar. Based on this study, we propose that avatars representing users' actual appearance may be helpful in experiencing and evaluating some business areas related to users' lives in the real world (e.g., virtual apparel shopping, matchmaking, plastic surgery, fitness clubs, etc.); utilization of such avatars may be a new business opportunity likely to thrive in virtual worlds.},

Results Body image was significantly more negative after viewing thin media images than after viewing images of either average size models, plus size models, or inanimate objects. This effect was stronger for between?subjects designs, participants less than 19 years of age, and for participants who are vulnerable to activation of a thinness schema.

@article{Hooper2010aa,
	abstract = {Men who have sex with men (MSM) remain the largest population infected with HIV in the United States [1]. Although early (offline) prevention efforts were effective in reducing the spread of HIV [2], there has been a reversal in safer sex practices since the mid-1990s [3], leading researchers to conclude that HIV prevention efforts for MSM in the US have ``faltered'' [4]. Re-energizing HIV prevention for MSM remains an urgent priority in the fight against HIV/AIDS [5].

Increased sexual risk taking and rising HIV rates among MSM have coincided with the broad adoption of the Internet as a way for MSM to meet sexual partners [6]. The Internet is now the largest venue where MSM meet sexual partners [7]. A meta-analysis of 14 studies from 1999 to 2005 reported a weighted mean estimate of 40% of MSM meeting their sex partners online [8]. However, the analysis is now dated, the range of estimates was large (23% to 99%) and highly dependent upon the recruitment methods used [8].

Clinic studies have identified Men who use the Internet to seek sex with men (MISM) as at higher risk for HIV/STIs than other MSM [9]. Internet sex-seeking appears to increase risk through an increased number of partners [10] and therefore increased probability of sexual risk behavior [6, 11]. Tracing STI outbreaks [12] and HIV transmission [13] through Internet-mediated liaisons is well-documented.

Given the global reach of the World Wide Web, its accessibility, affordability, anonymity, and popularity for sex-seeking among MSM [14], Internet-based interventions hold exceptional promise to address the global pandemic of HIV among MSM if they can be shown to reduce unsafe sexual behavior. The long-term objective of this research is to develop Internet-based interventions strong enough to lower sexual risk behavior among MISM.

To date, three online interventions for adult MISM have been rigorously evaluated. These programs used tailored messaging to MISM entering relationships [15], visual stories to promote HIV testing and to reduce unsafe sex [16], and ``gay'' avatars on a virtual cruise [17]. However, two of the trials [15, 17] experienced attrition rates of 70--80%, preventing meaningful interpretation of results, while the third [16] did not attempt to measure behavior change. Thus, attrition in online interventions appears a major challenge.},

@article{Sturm:2005aa,
	abstract = {The number of overweight and obese youth has increased in recent decades, yet few data assess how the lives of children have changed during the "obesity epidemic." Part 1 of this two-part study discussed trends in time use, studying at home, and media use. Part 2 focuses on transportation, physical education, and diet. Walking or biking for transportation can expend a large amount of energy, but active transportation is not a major source of physical activity for youth, averaging eight minutes a day in 2001, with little change over the past few decades. For adolescents, there was no clear trend in physical education during the past decade, but there are no data for after-school and day-care programs, which have become more important as children spend more time away from home. For younger children, time spent in organized sports and outdoor activities increased by 73 minutes per week between 1981 and 1997. Eating as a primary activity declined, suggesting a shift toward snacking or eating as a secondary activity. Statistically significant trends exist for carbohydrate intake, especially for chips/crackers/popcorn/pretzels (intake tripled from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s) and soft drinks (intake doubled during the same period). Price and income data suggest possible economic reasons for these changes. The percentage of disposable income spent on food has declined continuously, and almost all of the decline has been represented by food consumed at home, yet today's disposable income buys more calories than it has in the past. Relative prices have encouraged shifts across food types. From a baseline of 100 during 1982-84, the price index for fresh fruit and vegetables increased to 258 by 2002 (far exceeding general inflation), whereas the price index for soft drinks increased only to 126 by 2002 (below general inflation).},

	abstract = {Self-endorsing-the portrayal of potential consumers using products-is a novel advertising strategy made possible by the development of virtual environments. Three experiments compared self-endorsing to endorsing by an unfamiliar other. In Experiment 1, self-endorsing in online advertisements led to higher brand attitude and purchase intention than other-endorsing. Moreover, photographs were a more effective persuasion channel than text. In Experiment 2, participants wore a brand of clothing in a high-immersive virtual environment and preferred the brand worn by their virtual self to the brand worn by others. Experiment 3 demonstrated that an additional mechanism behind self-endorsing was the interactivity of the virtual representation. Evidence for self-referencing as a mediator is presented. {$[$}ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR{$]$}; Copyright of Journal of Advertising is the property of Taylor \& Francis Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

During exercise, participants viewed a television show that contained either media-portrayed ideal or neutral female body images. There were no differences in exercise performance between conditions. Physical appearance state anxiety (PASA) decreased post-exercise. After viewing ideal bodies, participants scored higher on appearance and comparison processing. The high internalization group scored higher on appearance and comparison processing and PASA increased following ideal body image content while the low internalization group decreased.},

  abstract      = {This study was designed to investigate experiences of maintaining and dropping out of a gym-based exercise programme. Interviews were carried out with 14 people, aged 19--32 years, comprising seven men and two women who had maintained their gym membership and three women and two men who had not. Member validation interviews were conducted 20 months later with one man who was previously maintaining but had since dropped out, and one woman originally not maintaining who had at the time of validation been maintaining for three months. Data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis, highlighting five themes. Upward social comparisons, gym culture and exercise habit were discussed by both adherers and non-adherers. The different ways the participants experienced these themes led to different outcomes in exercise status. Adherers discussed exercise dependency in relation to the meaning of the gym and their long-term commitment. Loss of social support contributed to dropout. The role of gender was highlighted with particular relevance to social comparison, culture and social support. Participants described a masculine gym culture, which produced contrasting effects on adherence. Upward social comparisons and lack of social support impacted negatively on adherence in females with poor body satisfaction. This is the first study to investigate qualitatively exercise adherence in males and females who have both adhered to and dropped out of an exercise programme. It identifies themes that have previously received little or no attention in the adherence field and results have implications for our understanding of factors influencing adherence to gym-based exercise programmes in men and women.},

	abstract = {Because scientists tend to report only studies (publication bias) or analyses (p-hacking) that ``work'', readers must ask, ``Are these effects true, or do they merely reflect selective reporting?'' We introduce p-curve as a way to answer this question. P-curve is the distribution of statistically significant p-values for a set of studies (ps < .05). Because only true effects are expected to generate right-skewed p-curves -- containing more low (.01s) than high (.04s) significant p-values -- only right-skewed p-curves are diagnostic of evidential value. By telling us whether we can rule out selective reporting as the sole explanation for a set of findings, p-curve offers a solution to the age-old inferential problems caused by file-drawers of failed studies and analyses.},

	abstract = {We study the influence of gender and gender pairing on economic decision making in an experimental two-person bargaining game where the other party's gender is known to both actors. We find that (1) gender per se has no significant effect on behavior, whereas (2) gender pairing systematically affects behavior. In particular, we observe much more competition and retaliation and, thus, lower efficiency when the bargaining partners have the same gender than when they have the opposite gender. These findings are consistent with predictions from evolutionary psychology. Implications of our results for real-world organizations are discussed.},

@article{Niedenthal:2005aa,
	abstract = {Findings in the social psychology literatures on attitudes, social perception, and emotion demonstrate that social information processing involves embodiment, where embodiment refers both to actual bodily states and to simulations of experience in the brain's modality-specific systems for perception, action, and introspection. We show that embodiment underlies social information processing when the perceiver interacts with actual social objects (online cognition) and when the perceiver represents social objects in their absence (offline cognition). Although many empirical demonstrations of social embodiment exist, no particularly compelling account of them has been offered. We propose that theories of embodied cognition, such as the Perceptual Symbol Systems (PSS) account (Barsalou, 1999), explain and integrate these findings, and that they also suggest exciting new directions for research. We compare the PSS account to a variety of related proposals and show how it addresses criticisms that have previously posed problems for the general embodiment approach.},

	abstract = {Previous research has associated men's physical features such as height and Shoulder-to-Hip Ratio (SHR) with dominance. Proxemics literature has suggested that the interpersonal space (comfort distance) increases in threatening and uncomfortable situations and decreases in unthreatening and comfortable situations. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the effect of different heights and SHRs on comfortable interpersonal distance by systematic manipulation of virtual confederates bodily features. More specifically, participants determined their comfort distances from virtual male confederates with different heights and SHRs in a virtual environment. We hypothesized that a virtual confederate's height and SHR influences the perception of interpersonal dominance; and consequently interpersonal space increases for taller and broader confederates as a result of increased interpersonal dominance. Results showed that comfortable interpersonal distance was positively associated with height for male participants, but not for female participants. No effect was found for shoulder width, neither for male nor female participants. Results were discussed in terms of the importance of height as a signal of dominance and fighting ability.},

@article{Kuyken:2009aa,
	abstract = {It has long been noted that the emotional impact of an autobiographical memory is associated with the vantage perspective from which it is recalled (Freud, 1950). Memories recalled from a first-person ?field? perspective are phenomenologically rich, while third-person ?observer? perspective memories contain more descriptive but less affective detail (Nigro \& Neisser, 1983). Although there is some evidence that depressed individuals retrieve more observer memories than non-depressed individuals (e.g., Kuyken \& Howell, 2006), little is known of the cognitive mechanisms associated with observer memories in depression. At pre- and post-treatment, 123 patients with a history of recurrent depression completed self-report measures and the autobiographical memory task (AMT). Participants also indicated the vantage perspective of the memories recalled on the AMT. Observer memories were less vivid, older, and more frequently rehearsed. The tendency to retrieve observer perspective memories was associated with greater negative self-evaluation, lower dispositional mindfulness, and greater use of avoidance. Furthermore, participants who recalled more field perspective memories at pre-treatment had lower levels of post-treatment depression, controlling for pre-treatment levels of depression and trait rumination. We apply contemporary accounts from social and cognitive psychology, and propose potential mechanisms that link the tendency to retrieve observer perspective memories to depression.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we attempt to make a distinction between egocentrism and allocentrism in social cognition, based on the distinction that is made in visuo-spatial perception. We propose that it makes a difference to mentalizing whether the other person can be understood using an egocentric (``you'') or an allocentric (``he/she/they'') stance. Within an egocentric stance, the other person is represented in relation to the self. By contrast, within an allocentric stance, the existence or mental state of the other person needs to be represented as independent from the self. We suggest here that people with Asperger syndrome suffer from a disconnection between a strong na{\"\i}ve egocentric stance and a highly abstract allocentric stance. We argue that the currently used distinction between first-person and third-person perspective-taking is orthogonal to the distinction between an egocentric and an allocentric stance and therefore cannot serve as a critical test of allocentrism.},

	n2 = {Background Altering the normal association between touch and its visual correlate can result in the illusory perception of a fake limb as part of our own body. Thus, when touch is seen to be applied to a rubber hand while felt synchronously on the corresponding hidden real hand, an illusion of ownership of the rubber hand usually occurs. The illusion has also been demonstrated using visuomotor correlation between the movements of the hidden real hand and the seen fake hand. This type of paradigm has been used with respect to the whole body generating out-of-the-body and body substitution illusions. However, such studies have only ever manipulated a single factor and although they used a form of virtual reality have not exploited the power of immersive virtual reality (IVR) to produce radical transformations in body ownership. Principal Findings Here we show that a first person perspective of a life-sized virtual human female body that appears to substitute the male subjects' own bodies was sufficient to generate a body transfer illusion. This was demonstrated subjectively by questionnaire and physiologically through heart-rate deceleration in response to a threat to the virtual body. This finding is in contrast to earlier experimental studies that assume visuotactile synchrony to be the critical contributory factor in ownership illusions. Our finding was possible because IVR allowed us to use a novel experimental design for this type of problem with three independent binary factors: (i) perspective position (first or third), (ii) synchronous or asynchronous mirror reflections and (iii) synchrony or asynchrony between felt and seen touch. Conclusions The results support the notion that bottom-up perceptual mechanisms can temporarily override top down knowledge resulting in a radical illusion of transfer of body ownership. The research also illustrates immersive virtual reality as a powerful tool in the study of body representation and experience, since it supports experimental manipulations that would otherwise be infeasible, with the technology being mature enough to represent human bodies and their motion.},

	abstract = {Power is the ability to influence others towards the attainment of specific goals, and it is a fundamental force that shapes behavior at all levels of human existence. Several theories on the nature of power in social life exist, especially in the context of social influence. Yet, in bargaining situations, surprisingly little is known about its role in shaping social preferences. Such preferences are considered to be the main explanation for observed behavior in a wide range of experimental settings. In this work, we set out to understand the role of bargaining power in the stylized environment of a Generalized Ultimatum Game (GUG). We modify the payoff structure of the standard Ultimatum Game (UG) to investigate three situations: two in which the power balance is either against the proposer or against the responder, and a balanced situation. We find that other-regarding preferences, as measured by the amount of money donated by participants, do not change with the amount of power, but power changes the offers and acceptance rates systematically. Notably, unusually high acceptance rates for lower offers were observed. This finding suggests that social preferences may be invariant to the balance of power and confirms that the role of power on human behavior deserves more attention.},

@article{Lyons:2015aa,
	abstract = {Results: Feedback is found in nearly all exergames, and richer, more in-depth feedback is associated with increased activity. Challenge is a vital component of any videogame, and exergames include physical as well as cognitive challenges. Flow states have traditionally been conceptualized as occurring when an optimal match between player skills and game challenge occurs. However, failure and retrial are necessary for feelings of overall satisfaction and fun, despite not necessarily being ideally fun or satisfying themselves. Rewards are a more complicated issue, with significant theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting positive and negative effects of reward systems. How rewards are integrated into the mechanics and storyline of the game likely impacts how they are perceived and, thus, their effectiveness. Finally, integration of these mechanisms into exergames requires specific attention to both cognitive and physical implementations. Movements that are not themselves enjoyable or engaging may lead to cheating and lower energy expenditure.

Conclusions: Feedback, challenge, and rewards are promising mechanisms by which exergames could become more enjoyable. How these concepts are operationalized can affect physical and psychological reactions to exergames. Attention to these concepts in future exergame development and implementation would benefit theory, research, and practice.},

@article{NowakFoxAvatar,
	abstract = {Avatars are growing in popularity and present in many interfaces used for computer-mediated communication (CMC) in- cluding social media, e-commerce, and educational applications. Communication researchers have been investigating avatars for over twenty years, and an examination of this literature reveals similarities but also notable discrepancies in conceptual definitions. The goal of this review is to provide a general overview of current debates, methodological approaches, and trends in findings. Our review synthesizes previous research in four areas. First, we examine how scholars have conceptualized the term ``avatar,'' identify similarities and differences across these definitions, and recommend that scholars use the term consistently. Next, we review theoretical perspectives relevant to avatar perception (e.g., the computers as social actors framework). Then, we examine avatar characteristics that communicators use to discern the humanity and social potential of an avatar (anthropomorphism, form realism, behavioral realism, and perceived agency) and discuss implications for at- tributions and communication outcomes. We also review findings on the social categorization of avatars, such as when people apply categories like sex, gender, race, and ethnicity to their evaluations of digital representations. Finally, we exam- ine research on avatar selection and design relevant to communication outcomes. Here, we review both motivations in CMC contexts (such as self-presentation and identity expression) and potential effects (e.g., persuasion). We conclude with a dis- cussion of future directions for avatar research and propose that communication researchers consider avatars not just as a topic of study, but also as a tool for testing theories and understanding critical elements of human communication. Avatar- mediated environments provide researchers with a number of advantageous technological affordances that can enable manipulations that may be difficult or inadvisable to execute in natural environments. We conclude by discussing the use of avatar research to extend communication theory and our understanding of communication processes.},

@article{10.3389/fnhum.2014.00844,
	abstract = {Craving is recognized as an important diagnosis criterion for substance use disorders (SUDs) and a predictive factor of relapse. Various methods to study craving exist, however, suppressing craving to successfully promote abstinence remains an unmet clinical need in SUDs. One reason is that social and environmental contexts recalling drug and alcohol consumption in the everyday life of patients suffering from SUDs often initiate craving and provoke relapse.
Current behavioural therapies for SUDs use the cue-exposure approach to suppress salience of social and environmental contexts that may induce craving. They facilitate learning and cognitive reinforcement of new behavior and entrain craving suppression in the presence of cues related to drug and alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, craving often overweighs behavioural training especially in real social and environmental contexts with peer-pressure encouraging the use of substance, such as parties and bars. 
In this perspective, virtual reality is gaining interest in the development of cue-reactivity paradigms and practice new skills in treatment. Virtual reality enhances ecological validity of traditional craving induction measurement. In this review, we discuss results from 1) studies using virtual reality and alternative virtual agents in the induction of craving and 2) studies combining cue-exposure therapy with virtual reality in the promotion of abstinence from drugs and alcohol use. They used virtual environments, displaying alcohol and drugs to SUD patients. Moreover, some environments included avatars. Hence, some studies have focused on the social interactions that are associated with drug seeking behaviours and peer pressure.
Findings indicate that virtual reality can successfully increase craving. Studies combining cue exposure-therapy with virtual environment however reported mitigated success so far.},

@article{stulp2015human,
	abstract = {Across cultures, taller stature is linked to increased social status, but the potential reasons why this should be are unclear. One potential explanation is that taller individuals are more likely to win a dyadic confrontation with a competitor (i.e., they are more dominant), which leads to higher social rank. Although some previous studies have shown that perceptions of status or dominance are related to height, and are therefore consistent with such an explanation, there is surprisingly little research testing whether height actually has any influence on the behavioural outcomes in real-life social interactions. Here, we present three naturalistic observational studies demonstrating that height predicts interpersonal dominance during brief dyadic interactions. Study 1 investigated the likelihood of giving way in a narrow passage (N = 92); Study 2 investigated giving way in a busy shopping street, plus the likelihood of colliding with another individual (N = 1,108); and Study 3 investigated the likelihood of maintaining a linear path while walking, and potentially entering another individual's personal space (N = 1,056). We conclude that human height is positively related to interpersonal dominance, and may well contribute to the widely observed positive association between height and social status.},

	abstract = {One possible reason for the continued neglect of statistical power analysis in research in the behavioral sciences is the inaccessibility of or difficulty with the standard material. A convenient, although not comprehensive, presentation of required sample sizes is provided here. Effect-size indexes and conventional values for these are given for operationally defined small, medium, and large effects. The sample sizes necessary for .80 power to detect effects at these levels are tabled for eight standard statistical tests: (a) the difference between independent means, (b) the significance of a product-moment correlation, (c) the difference between independent rs, (d) the sign test, (e) the difference between independent proportions, (f) chi-square tests for goodness of fit and contingency tables, (g) one-way analysis of variance, and (h) the significance of a multiple or multiple partial correlation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Positive body image has been found to be associated with various beneficial health-related indicators among women. Yet, less is known about its health-related correlates among men. The goal of the current study was to examine associations between positive body image and various mental and physical health-related indicators in both men and women. Undergraduate students (N=284) from a non-residential college in the northeastern United States participated. Individuals with greater positive body image reported less depression, higher self-esteem, fewer unhealthy dieting behaviors, lower drive for muscularity, and greater intentions to protect their skin from UV exposure and damage. Gender did not moderate these associations; thus, connections between positive body image and health-related indicators were similar for women and men. Results suggest that positive body image has significant implications for health and well-being beyond objective body size. Health care providers should encourage positive body image because of its potential health benefits.},

@article{grogan:2017aa,
	abstract = {Objective: This study was designed to investigate whether whole-body scanning might promote healthy eating and physical activity in women, and to explore the effects of scanning on body image. Design: Fourteen women aged 22-45 years without histories of eating disorders or whole-body scanning, took part in semi-structured interviews before and after scanning. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Scans did not look as expected, and participants expressed `surprise' and `shock'. Participants focused on perceived negative aspects of their bodies as revealed in scan images, and agreed that women with body concerns would find scans too `real' and `raw'. Eleven women who met UK government physical activity and healthy eating guidelines reported that the scan provided additional motivation to maintain, and in nine cases to increase, those behaviours. Two women who neither exercised nor ate healthily would not increase physical activity or change their diets following scanning. Conclusion: Whole-body scanning may enable maintenance or even acceleration of physical activity and healthy eating, but is unlikely to be useful in promoting initiation of these behaviours. Participants engaged in unhelpful body critique when viewing scans; scanning needs to be confined to contexts where support is provided, to avoid increasing body-related concerns.},

@article{Hoeting:1999aa,
	abstract = {Standard statistical practice ignores model uncertainty. Data analysts typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed as if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-confident inferences and decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian model averaging (BMA)provides a coherent mechanism for accounting for this model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA have recently emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number of examples.In these examples, BMA provides improved out-of-sample predictive performance. We also provide a catalogue of currently available BMA software.},

@article{Guan:2016aa,
	abstract = {The reliability of published research findings in psychology has been a topic of rising concern. Publication bias, or treating positive findings differently from negative findings, is a contributing factor to this ``crisis of confidence,''in that it likely inflates the number of false-positive effects in the literature. We demonstrate a Bayesian model averaging approach that takes into account the possibility of publication bias and allows for a better estimate of true underlying effect size. Accounting for the possibility of bias leads to a more conservative interpretation of published studies as well as meta-analyses. We provide mathematical details of the method and examples.},

The random effect model assumes that the distribution of the treatment effect is fully heterogenous across the experiments.

	abstract = {Avatar creation is an interesting topic for both video game and social network studies. Research has shown that the creation of avatars is influenced by individual, contextual, and cultural features. Avatars are used to represent aspects of users' personality, but multiple avatars are used in different virtual contexts, as self-presentation strategies may vary according to the different "audiences" to be met online (say: friends, or strangers). Moreover, avatar creation is also influenced by cultural variables, such as gender, as avatars embody stereotypical aspects of being a woman or a man. This research tested whether avatars, as digital self-representations, may change depending on the above-mentioned variables. Ninety-four participants created two avatars to be used in different contexts (video game and job-themed social network). Moreover, two groups of participants were told that they would have met friends or total strangers within the two virtual contexts. Results showed that avatars changed from the game to the job context. Changes involved avatars' transient features (Clothes) more than physical (Body) and symbolic (Accessories) ones, and females changed accessories more than males. Moreover, females who expected to meet friends changed their avatars' bodies significantly more than males in both virtual contexts. The findings are discussed based on literature about computer-mediated communication and online self-disclosure. In conclusion, possible implications of the results for avatar-based interventions and the field of video games and social network design are reviewed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rapid growth in Smartphone use among children affords potential opportunities to target health behaviors such as dietary habits; however, few mobile health applications are specifically designed with these individuals in mind. This brief report describes our step-by-step approach towards developing a mobile health application for targeting nutrition behaviors among children. METHODS: Descriptions of the 10 most popular paid and 10 most popular free Smartphone applications available on the Apple iTunes store for ages 4 and up as of March 2012 were qualitatively analyzed. The relevance of key characteristics found in these applications was then further explored for their potential to improve dietary behaviours amongst children, and a mobile application was developed. RESULTS: Three prominent characteristics of the most popular applications emerged: 1) virtual avatars or characters (observed in 50% of the applications); 2) gaming (observed in 75% of the applications); and 3) social media (observed in 45% of the applications). These features were then incorporated into the design of a mobile health application called Avafeed, which uses a virtual avatar and gaming to help make choosing healthier food options easier among children. The application was successfully released onto the Apple iTunes Store in September 2012. CONCLUSIONS: In this unconventional approach, evidence-based research was combined with information procured from a qualitative review of popular applications available on the Apple iTunes Store in order to design a potentially relevant and popular mobile health application for use among children.},

@article{Hone-Blanchet:2014aa,
	abstract = {Craving is recognized as an important diagnosis criterion for substance use disorders (SUDs) and a predictive factor of relapse. Various methods to study craving exist; however, suppressing craving to successfully promote abstinence remains an unmet clinical need in SUDs. One reason is that social and environmental contexts recalling drug and alcohol consumption in the everyday life of patients suffering from SUDs often initiate craving and provoke relapse. Current behavioral therapies for SUDs use the cue-exposure approach to suppress salience of social and environmental contexts that may induce craving. They facilitate learning and cognitive reinforcement of new behavior and entrain craving suppression in the presence of cues related to drug and alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, craving often overweighs behavioral training especially in real social and environmental contexts with peer pressure encouraging the use of substance, such as parties and bars. In this perspective, virtual reality (VR) is gaining interest in the development of cue-reactivity paradigms and practices new skills in treatment. VR enhances ecological validity of traditional craving-induction measurement. In this review, we discuss results from (1) studies using VR and alternative virtual agents in the induction of craving and (2) studies combining cue-exposure therapy with VR in the promotion of abstinence from drugs and alcohol use. They used virtual environments, displaying alcohol and drugs to SUD patients. Moreover, some environments included avatars. Hence, some studies have focused on the social interactions that are associated with drug-seeking behaviors and peer pressure. Findings indicate that VR can successfully increase craving. Studies combining cue-exposure therapy with virtual environment, however, reported mitigated success so far.},

@article{Pericot-Valverde:2014aa,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION:: Cigarette cravings have been associated with less successful attempts to quit smoking and a greater likelihood of relapse after smoking cessation. Background craving refers to a relatively steady and continuous experience of craving, while cue-induced craving refers to phases of intense craving triggered by cues associated with smoking. Cue exposure treatment (CET) involves repeated exposure to stimuli associated with substance use in order to reduce craving responses. However, mixed results have been found regarding the effect of CET on both types of craving. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of systematic virtual reality cue exposure treatment (VR-CET) on background and cue-induced cravings. METHODS:: Participants were 48 treatment-seeking smokers. The VR-CET consisted of prolonged exposure sessions to several interactive virtual environments. The VR-CET was applied once a week over 5 weeks. An individualized hierarchy of exposure was drawn up for each patient starting from the easiest virtual environment. Background and cue-induced cravings were recorded in each session. RESULTS:: Cue-induced craving decreased over each session as a result of prolonged exposure. VR-CET also reduced cue-induced and background cravings across the 5 sessions, showing a cumulative effect across the exposure sessions. CONCLUSIONS:: Our results evidenced the utility of VR-CET in reducing both types of cigarette craving. A combination of CET through VR with psychological treatments may improve current treatments for smoking cessation.},

	abstract = {This article reviews research into the use of virtual reality in the study, assessment, and treatment of body image disturbances in eating disorders and nonclinical samples. During the last decade, virtual reality has emerged as a technology that is especially suitable not only for the assessment of body image disturbances but also for its treatment. Indeed, several virtual environment-based software systems have been developed for this purpose. Furthermore, virtual reality seems to be a good alternative to guided imagery and in vivo exposure, and is therefore very useful for studies that require exposure to life-like situations but which are difficult to conduct in the real world. Nevertheless, review highlights the lack of published controlled studies and the presence of methodological drawbacks that should be considered in future studies. This article also discusses the implications of the results obtained and proposes directions for future research.},

Two studies tested the power of embodied experiences within IVEs by comparing the effects of cutting a virtual tree against reading a print description or watching a video depiction of the tree-cutting process to encourage paper conservation. Experiment 1 found that IVEs led participants to consume 20{\%} less paper than participants who read a print description of tree cutting. Experiment 2 demonstrated that IVEs elicited greater self-reported internal environmental locus of control and self-reported environmental behaviors than print and video messages one week following the virtual experience. Moreover, internal environmental locus of control served as a mediator, driving environmental behaviors. We discuss the implications of using embodied experiences for behavior change.},

The repeated-exposure paradigm can be regarded as a form of classical conditioning if we assume that the absence of aversive events constitutes the unconditioned stimulus.

@article{Behm-Morawitz:2016aa,
	abstract = {Health self-efficacy, or the beliefs in one's capabilities to perform health behaviors, is a significant factor in eliciting health behavior change, such as weight loss. Research has demonstrated that virtual embodiment has the potential to alter one's psychology and physicality, particularly in health contexts; however, little is known about the impacts embodiment in a virtual world has on health self-efficacy. The present research is a randomized controlled trial (N = 90) examining the effectiveness of virtual embodiment and play in a social virtual world (Second Life {$[$}SL{$]$}) for increasing health self-efficacy (exercise and nutrition efficacy) among overweight adults. Participants were randomly assigned to a 3D social virtual world (avatar virtual interaction experimental condition), 2D social networking site (no avatar virtual interaction control condition), or no intervention (no virtual interaction control condition). The findings of this study provide initial evidence for the use of SL to improve exercise efficacy and to support weight loss. Results also suggest that individuals who have higher self-presence with their avatar reap more benefits. Finally, quantitative findings are triangulated with qualitative data to increase confidence in the results and provide richer insight into the perceived effectiveness and limitations of SL for meeting weight loss goals. Themes resulting from the qualitative analysis indicate that participation in SL can improve motivation and efficacy to try new physical activities; however, individuals who have a dislike for video games may not be benefitted by avatar-based virtual interventions. Implications for research on the transformative potential of virtual embodiment and self-presence in general are discussed. {\copyright}Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.},

@book{AhnFoxVEAHealth,
	abstract = {Immersive virtual environments (IVEs) are systems comprised of digital devices that simulate multiple layers of sensory information so that users experience sight, sound, and even touch like they do in the physical world. Users are typically represented in these environments in the form of virtual humans and may interact with other virtual representations such as health-care providers, coaches, future selves, or treatment stimuli (e.g., phobia triggers, such as crowds of people or spiders). These virtual representations can be controlled by humans (avatars) or computers algorithms (agents). Embodying avatars and interacting with agents, patients can experience sensory-rich simulations in the virtual world that may be difficult or even impossible to experience in the physical world but are sufficiently real to influence health attitudes and behaviors. Avatars and agents are infinitely customizable to tailor virtual experiences at the individual level, and IVEs are able to transcend the spatial and temporal boundaries of the physical world. Although still preliminary, a growing number of studies demonstrate IVEs'potential as a health promotion and therapy tool, complementing and enhancing current treatment regimens. Attempts to incorporate IVEs into treatments and intervention programs have been made in a number of areas, including physical activity, nutrition, rehabilitation, exposure therapy, and autism spectrum disorders. Although further development and research is necessary, the increasing availability of consumer-grade IVE systems may allow clinicians and patients to consider IVE treatment as a routine part of their regimen in the near future.},

@article{JCC4:JCC48,
	abstract = {It has become increasingly common for Web sites and computer media to provide computer generated visual images, called avatars, to represent users and bots during online interactions. In this study, participants (N = 255) evaluated a series of avatars in a static context in terms of their androgyny, anthropomorphism, credibility, homophily, attraction, and the likelihood they would choose them during an interaction. The responses to the images were consistent with what would be predicted by uncertainty reduction theory. The results show that the masculinity or femininity (lack of androgyny) of an avatar, as well as anthropomorphism, significantly influence perceptions of avatars. Further, more anthropomorphic avatars were perceived to be more attractive and credible, and people were more likely to choose to be represented by them. Participants reported masculine avatars as less attractive than feminine avatars, and most people reported a preference for human avatars that matched their gender. Practical and theoretical implications of these results for users, designers, and researchers of avatars are discussed.},

	abstract = {This study examined how avatar body size (normal, obese) and opponent character body size (normal, obese) influenced physical activity while male participants played an exergame. Males operating normal weight avatars showed more physical activity than those using obese avatars. Perceived avatar and opponent character body-size differences moderated the effect of avatar appearance on physical activity. Participants showed decreased physical activity when the opponent character was perceived as slightly more obese than their avatar. Participants also showed decreased physical activity when their avatar was perceived as more obese than the opponent character. We discuss theoretical implications and applications of using virtual characters to increase gamers' physical activity. These findings are also compared to an earlier study with an all-female sample.},

	abstract = {Body image disturbance (BID) is implicated in the etiology, maintenance, and relapse of the eating disorders, and remains challenging to treat. New paradigms such as virtual reality (VR) may offer an ecologically viable method to assess and treat BID. This pilot study aimed to determine if a VR environment could elicit increased BID in a nonclinical group of women who were dieting due to body image concerns or nonclinical women who were not dieting. Forty-one nonclinical females participated in the VR paradigm (a London Bus Journey), completing pre and post measures of body image satisfaction, and social evaluative concerns. Results did not support the hypothesis that the virtual London Bus would elicit increased BID. However, dieters reported significantly higher levels of social evaluative concerns and comparison to avatars during the virtual environment compared with nondieters. Participants reported acceptable levels of sense of presence and enjoyment of the VR environment. Possible explanations for the failure of the VR environment to trigger increased BID are discussed, including choice of environment and avatar fidelity. In conclusion, this pilot study suggests that VR might have potential in the treatment of disturbed body image, while highlighting the need for further research into the required levels of representational and behavioral fidelity of virtual environments and avatars. {$[$}ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR{$]$}; Copyright of CyberPsychology, Behavior \& Social Networking is the property of Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

@article{Kuo:2016aa,
	abstract = {The tendency to discount larger future benefits in favor of smaller immediate gains (i.e., temporal discounting) is relevant to the issue of obesity. Successful weight loss requires individuals to sacrifice immediate culinary pleasures in favor of future health gains. Based on the notion that increasing the vividness of one's future self may mitigate temporal discounting and promote the ability to delay gratification, we examined whether viewing one's weight-reduced self (i.e., the ideal self) in a virtual environment can decrease temporal discounting and lead to better regulation of dietary practices. Seventy-six undergraduates who had reported an intention to lose weight were recruited to participate in a laboratory experiment and were randomly assigned to interact with either the weight-reduced self (experimental condition) or the present self (control condition) by looking into a dressing mirror in a virtual fitting room. A temporal-discounting task and a taste test were subsequently administered. Results showed that, compared with control participants, participants who viewed their weight-reduced avatars ate less ice cream in a taste test and were more likely to choose a sugar-free drink as a reward. The discounting rate mediated the association between the avatar manipulation and the amount of ice cream eaten in the subsequent taste test. Overall, our findings suggest that a computer-generated image of one's weight-reduced self may assist in resisting impulses that promote immediate gratification over delayed benefits. This research provides a new approach for controlling impulsive behavior such as dietary regulation and weight control. {$[$}ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR{$]$}; Copyright of CyberPsychology, Behavior \& Social Networking is the property of Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

@article{Neupert:2009aa,
	abstract = {The present study examined exercise self-efficacy and exercise behavior during and after a strength training intervention program with older adults. A model with cross-lagged and contemporaneous paths was tested with structural equations. Within testing occasions, higher physical resistance was related to greater beliefs in efficacy and control over exercise. At 3 months into the intervention, those who had higher physical resistance were less likely to show subsequent changes in beliefs. Those who had higher self-efficacy and control beliefs at 6 months were more likely to report that they were still exercising at 9 and 12 months after the intervention. Findings indicate that exercise self-efficacy and exercise behavior are associated with one another, and that beliefs developed during an intervention are important for maintenance of an exercise regimen.},

@article{Webb:2006aa,
	abstract = {Numerous theories in social and health psychology assume that intentions cause behaviors. However, most tests of the intention- behavior relation involve correlational studies that preclude causal inferences. In order to determine whether changes in behavioral intention engender behavior change, participants should be assigned randomly to a treatment that significantly increases the strength of respective intentions relative to a control condition, and differences in subsequent behavior should be compared. The present research obtained 47 experimental tests of intention-behavior relations that satisfied these criteria. Meta-analysis showed that a medium-to-large change in intention (d = 0.66) leads to a small-to-medium change in behavior (d = 0.36). The review also identified several conceptual factors, methodological features, and intervention characteristics that moderate intention-behavior consistency.},

  abstract      = {Existing research has investigated whether virtual representations perceived to be controlled by humans (i.e., avatars) or those perceived to be controlled by computer algorithms (i.e., agents) are more influential. A meta-analysis (N = 32) examined the model of social influence in virtual environments (Blascovich, 2002) and investigated whether agents and avatars in virtual environments elicit different levels of social influence. Results indicated that perceived avatars produced stronger responses than perceived agents. Level of immersion (desktop vs. fully immersive), dependent variable type (subjective vs. objective), task type (competitive vs. cooperative vs. neutral), and actual control of the representation (human vs. computer) were examined as moderators. An interaction effect revealed that studies conducted on a desktop that used objective measures showed a stronger effect for agency than those that were conducted on a desktop but used subjective measures. Competitive and cooperative tasks showed greater agency effects than neutral tasks. Studies in which both conditions were actually human controlled showed greater agency effects than studies in which both conditions were actually computer controlled. We discuss theoretical and design implications for human--computer interaction and computer-mediated communication.},

@article{Nauroth:2014aa,
	abstract = {This article explores the notion that scientific research programs and empirical findings are fundamentally devalued when they threaten a perceiver's social identity. Findings from three studies show the following: (1) identification with the group of ``gamers''(i.e., people who play video games on a regular basis) influences the extent to which perceivers devalue research suggesting that playing violent video games has negative consequences; (2) this effect is mediated by the feeling that the group of gamers is being stigmatized by such research (Studies 1 and 2) as well as by anger about this research (Study 2); (3) the effect of in-group identification on negative research evaluations cannot be explained by attitude or behavioral preference inconsistency (Studies 1 and 3); and (4) strongly identified gamers not only devalue a specific scientific study but also generalize their negative evaluations to the entire field of violent video games research (Study 3). The findings suggest that the influence of social identity processes on the evaluation of research is larger than it has previously been recognized. Implications of these findings for science communication are discussed. Copyright {\copyright}2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Outcomes from meta-analyses provide a more objective and transparent summary of a research area than traditional narrative reviews. Moreover, they are often used to support research grant applications, guide clinical practice, and direct health policy. The aim of this article is to provide a practical and non-technical guide for psychological scientists that outlines the steps involved in planning and performing a meta-analysis of correlational datasets. I provide a supplementary R script to demonstrate each analytical step described in the paper, which is readily adaptable for researchers to use for their analyses. While the worked example is the analysis of a correlational dataset, the general meta-analytic process described in this paper is applicable for all types of effect sizes. I also emphasize the importance of meta-analysis protocols and pre-registration to improve transparency and help avoid unintended duplication. An improved understanding this tool will not only help scientists to conduct their own meta-analyses but also improve their evaluation of published meta-analyses.},

Previous research has shown that this capability increases levels of aggression within socially acceptable forms of violence. Using the general aggression model (GAM), the current study examined the effect of avatar personalization on behavioral aggression within a violent video game. Participants who played a violent video game and designed their own avatars were significantly more aggressive than those who played the same violent video game with a generic avatar, and were also more aggressive than those who played the nonviolent video game, regardless of whether or not they designed their own personalized characters.

Results of construct validity analyses indicate that the proposed CA scale has a significant relationship with self-esteem, addiction, game enjoyment, and time spent playing games; all of these relationships are predicted by theory. Additionally, CA levels for role-playing games differ significantly from CA levels of other character-driven games.},

@article{Klimmt:2010aa,
	abstract = {Two experiments tested the prediction that video game players identify with the character or role they are assigned, which leads to automatic shifts in implicit self-perceptions. Video game identification, thus, is considered as a kind of altered self-experience. In Study 1 (N = 61), participants either played a first-person shooter game or a racing game. Subsequently, they performed an Implicit Association Test (IAT) designed to detect cognitive associations between character-related concepts and players' self. Findings indicate a stronger automatic association of military-related concepts to shooter players' self and a stronger association of racing-related concepts to racing game players' self. Study 2 (N = 48) replicated the IAT result from Study 1 and demonstrated the stability of the identification pattern. Implications for identification as an element of the video game experience and future research directions are discussed.},

Kontrastiert mit konventionellen (,dyadischen') Auffassungen von Mediennutzer-Charakter-Beziehungen (z.B. parasoziale Interaktion oder die Theorie der affektiven Disposition), ist eine (,monadische') Videospiel-Identifikation als eine temporare Verschiebung der Selbstwahrnehmung des Spielers durch die Ubernahme der wertgeschatzten Eigenschaften des Spielcharakters definiert.

@article{Abraham:2008aa,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Without standardized definitions of the techniques included in behavior change interventions, it is difficult to faithfully replicate effective interventions and challenging to identify techniques contributing to effectiveness across interventions. This research aimed to develop and test a theory-linked taxonomy of generally applicable behavior change techniques (BCTs). DESIGN: Twenty-six BCTs were defined. Two psychologists used a 5-page coding manual to independently judge the presence or absence of each technique in published intervention descriptions and in intervention manuals. RESULTS: Three systematic reviews yielded 195 published descriptions. Across 78 reliability tests (i.e., 26 techniques applied to 3 reviews), the average kappa per technique was 0.79, with 93% of judgments being agreements. Interventions were found to vary widely in the range and type of techniques used, even when targeting the same behavior among similar participants. The average agreement for intervention manuals was 85%, and a comparison of BCTs identified in 13 manuals and 13 published articles describing the same interventions generated a technique correspondence rate of 74%, with most mismatches (73%) arising from identification of a technique in the manual but not in the article. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing standardized definitions of BCTs included in behavioral interventions and highlight problematic variability in the reporting of intervention content.},

@article{Samdal:2017aa,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: This systematic review aims to explain the heterogeneity in results of interventions to promote physical activity and healthy eating for overweight and obese adults, by exploring the differential effects of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) and other intervention characteristics. METHODS: The inclusion criteria specified RCTs with ≥12 weeks'duration, from January 2007 to October 2014, for adults (mean age ≥40 years, mean BMI ≥30). Primary outcomes were measures of healthy diet or physical activity. Two reviewers rated study quality, coded the BCTs, and collected outcome results at short (≤6 months) and long term (≥12 months). Meta-analyses and meta-regressions were used to estimate effect sizes (ES), heterogeneity indices (I(2)) and regression coefficients. RESULTS: We included 48 studies containing a total of 82 outcome reports. The 32 long term reports had an overall ES = 0.24 with 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.15 to 0.33 and I(2) = 59.4{\%}. The 50 short term reports had an ES = 0.37 with 95{\%} CI: 0.26 to 0.48, and I(2) = 71.3{\%}. The number of BCTs unique to the intervention group, and the BCTs goal setting and self-monitoring of behaviour predicted the effect at short and long term. The total number of BCTs in both intervention arms and using the BCTs goal setting of outcome, feedback on outcome of behaviour, implementing graded tasks, and adding objects to the environment, e.g. using a step counter, significantly predicted the effect at long term. Setting a goal for change; and the presence of reporting bias independently explained 58.8{\%} of inter-study variation at short term. Autonomy supportive and person-centred methods as in Motivational Interviewing, the BCTs goal setting of behaviour, and receiving feedback on the outcome of behaviour, explained all of the between study variations in effects at long term. CONCLUSION: There are similarities, but also differences in effective BCTs promoting change in healthy eating and physical activity and BCTs supporting maintenance of change. The results support the use of goal setting and self-monitoring of behaviour when counselling overweight and obese adults. Several other BCTs as well as the use of a person-centred and autonomy supportive counselling approach seem important in order to maintain behaviour over time.

Cybersex is a growing phenomenon with a significant impact on participants but very little research has been done on this subject to date. This study is the first to attempt to delineate characteristics of those who engage in cybersex. Data were collected through an online questionnaire in Swedish, administered through the Swedish web portal Passagen.se. Out of the total sample (N = 1828), almost a third, both men and women, reported to have engaged in cybersex. A logistic regression analysis showed that age, sex, and sexual orientation were important demographic variables to consider when investigating cybersex. A comparison of interval data showed those engaging in cybersex to have a higher likelihood of spending more time online for OSA and having more offline sex partners than those not engaging in cybersex.},

The Bayes factor has an intuitive interpretation and allows a comparison between any two models, even models that are complex and nonnested. In this introduction to the special issue ``Bayes factors for Testing Hypotheses in Psychological Research: Practical Relevance and New Developments'', we first highlight the basic properties of the Bayes factor, stressing its advantages over classical significance testing. Next, we briefly discuss statistical software packages that are useful for researchers who wish to make the transition from p values to Bayes factors. We end by providing an overview of the contributions to this special issue. The contributions fall in three partly overlapping categories: those that present new philosophical insights, those that provide methodological innovations, and those that demonstrate practical applications.},

Using Jeffreys's Bayes factor hypothesis tests, researchers can grade the decisiveness of the evidence that the data provide for a point null hypothesis H 0 versus a composite alternative hypothesis H 1 . Consequently, Jeffreys's tests are of considerable theoretical and practical relevance for empirical researchers in general and for experimental psychologists in particular. To highlight this relevance and to facilitate the interpretation and use of Jeffreys's Bayes factor tests we focus on two common inferential scenarios: testing the nullity of a normal mean (i.e., the Bayesian equivalent of the t -test) and testing the nullity of a correlation. For both Bayes factor tests, we explain their development, we extend them to one-sided problems, and we apply them to concrete examples from experimental psychology.},

Our simple extension places priors and posteriors on the possible distributions of data outcomes, one of which represents the true state of the world---the observed data is a sample from that unknown true state. The proposed system infers the probability that a given data distribution is the true one, based on the observed sample of data; the posterior probabilities that given model instances provide best approximations to the truth can then be obtained directly.},

In response, Robert (2016) maintains that Bayes factors have a number of serious shortcomings. These shortcomings, Robert argues, may be addressed by an alternative approach that conceptualizes model selection as parameter estimation in a mixture model. In a second comment, Chandramouli and Shiffrin (2016) seek to extend Jeffreys's framework by also taking into consideration data distributions that do not originate from either of the models under test. In this rejoinder we argue that Robert's (2016) alternative view on testing has more in common with Jeffreys's Bayes factor than he suggests, as they share the same ``shortcomings''. On the other hand, we show that the proposition of Chandramouli and Shiffrin (2016) to extend the Bayes factor is in fact further removed from Jeffreys's view on testing than the authors suggest. By elaborating on these points, we hope to clarify our case for Jeffreys's Bayes factors.},

@article{Shiffrin:2016aa,
	abstract = {Abstract This article presents a non-technical perspective on two prominent methods for analyzing experimental data in order to select among model classes. Each class consists of model instances; each instance predicts a unique distribution of data outcomes. One method is Bayesian Model Selection (BMS), instantiated with the Bayes factor. The other is based on the Minimum Description Length principle (MDL), instantiated by a variant of Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML): the variant is termed NML* and takes prior probabilities into account. The methods are closely related. The Bayes factor is a ratio of two values: V 1 for model class M 1 , and V 2 for M 2 . Each V j is the sum over the instances of M j , of the joint probabilities (prior times likelihood) for the observed data, normalized by a sum of such sums for all possible data outcomes. NML* is qualitatively similar: The value it assigns to each class is the maximum over the instances in M i of the joint probability for the observed data normalized by a sum of such maxima for all possible data outcomes. The similarity of BMS to NML* is particularly close when model classes do not have instances that overlap, a way of comparing model classes that we advocate generally. These observations and suggestions are illustrated throughout with use of a simple example borrowed from Heck, Wagenmakers, and Morey (2015) in which the instances predict a binomial distribution of number of successes in N trials. The model classes posit the binomial probability of success to lie in various regions of the interval [0,1]. We illustrate the theory and the example not with equations but with tables coupled with simple arithmetic. Using the binomial example we carry out comparisons of BMS and NML* that do and do not involve model classes that overlap, and do and do not have uniform priors. When the classes do not overlap BMS and NML* produce qualitatively similar results.},

@article{Dienes:2016aa,
	abstract = {Abstract Bayes factors provide a symmetrical measure of evidence for one model versus another (e.g. H1 versus H0) in order to relate theory to data. These properties help solve some (but not all) of the problems underlying the credibility crisis in psychology. The symmetry of the measure of evidence means that there can be evidence for H0 just as much as for H1; or the Bayes factor may indicate insufficient evidence either way. P -values cannot make this three-way distinction. Thus, Bayes factors indicate when the data count against a theory (and when they count for nothing); and thus they indicate when replications actually support H0 or H1 (in ways that power cannot). There is every reason to publish evidence supporting the null as going against it, because the evidence can be measured to be just as strong either way (thus the published record can be more balanced). Bayes factors can be B -hacked but they mitigate the problem because a) they allow evidence in either direction so people will be less tempted to hack in just one direction; b) as a measure of evidence they are insensitive to the stopping rule; c) families of tests cannot be arbitrarily defined; and d) falsely implying a contrast is planned rather than post hoc becomes irrelevant (though the value of pre-registration is not mitigated).},

Both pre-experimental versions (involving the power and Type I error) and post-experimental versions (depending on the actual data) are considered. Implementations are provided that range from depending only on the p -value to consideration of full Bayesian analysis.

This Bayes factor balances between fit and complexity of order-constrained hypotheses in a natural way. A diffuse prior on the correlation matrix is used that minimizes prior shrinkage and results in most evidence for an order-constrained hypothesis that is supported by the data. An efficient method is proposed for the computation of the Bayes factor. A key aspect in the computation is a Fisher Z transformation on the posterior distribution of the correlations such that an approximately normal distribution is obtained. The methodology is implemented in a freely downloadable software program called ``BOCOR''. The methods are applied to a multitrait--multimethod analysis, a repeated measures study, and a study on directed moderator effects.},

These methods rely on assessing the monotonicity of a set of responses embedded within a state-space. Prince et al. (2012) proposed Bayes factors for state-trace analysis, allowing the assessment of the evidence for monotonicity within individuals. Under the assumption that the population is homogeneous, these Bayes factors can be combined across participants to produce a ``group'' Bayes factor comparing the monotone hypothesis to the non-monotone hypothesis. However, combining information across individuals without assuming homogeneity is problematic due to the nonparametric nature of state-trace analysis. We introduce group-level Bayes factors that can be used to assess the evidence that the population is homogeneous vs. heterogeneous, and demonstrate their utility using data from a visual change-detection task. Additionally, we describe new computational methods for rapidly computing individual-level Bayes factors.},

Default Bayes factors quantify the relative evidence between the null hypothesis and the unrestricted alternative hypothesis without needing to specify prior distributions for the unknown parameters based on one's prior beliefs. It is shown that in most typical situations in psychological research (when either observing no, small, medium or large effects) default Bayes factors are asymmetric in information, i.e., they result in unequal error probabilities. The tendency to either prefer the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis varies for different default Bayes factors. Although this asymmetry in information is a natural property of a Bayes factor, severe cases of asymmetry may be undesirable in a default setting because the underlying default priors are not a translation of one's prior beliefs. A calibration scheme is presented to make a default Bayes factor symmetric in information under certain conditions.},

We also introduce an improved definition of the penalty in this BIC approximation that accommodates the repeated-measures correlation through an effective sample size based on the Fisher Information. Monte Carlo simulations of repeated-measures data were used to compare the BIC method to two Bayesian procedures for analysis of variance (ANOVA) designs and to the standard null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) approach. When no effects of the independent variable were present in the populations and a reasonable sample size was used, the Bayesian methods consistently yielded posterior probabilities clearly favoring the null model. We discuss two different approaches to comparing the outcome of the Bayesian analyses with NHST results when an effect is present. In general, a direct comparison between NHST p values and Bayesian posterior probabilities indicates that the latter is somewhat conservative when effect size is small. We also derive a closed-form expression for approximating the posterior probability distributions for condition means in one-factor repeated-measures designs and present an R routine for computing these distributions and the posterior probability of H 0 that requires as input nothing more than values from a standard ANOVA.},

@article{Boing-Messing:2016aa,
	abstract = {Abstract Researchers are frequently interested in testing variances of two independent populations. We often would like to know whether the population variances are equal, whether population 1 has smaller variance than population 2, or whether population 1 has larger variance than population 2. In this article we consider the Bayes factor, a Bayesian model selection and hypothesis testing criterion, for this multiple hypothesis test. Application of Bayes factors requires specification of prior distributions for the model parameters. Automatic Bayes factors circumvent the difficult task of prior elicitation by using data-driven mechanisms to specify priors in an automatic fashion. In this article we develop different automatic Bayes factors for testing two variances: first we apply the fractional Bayes factor (FBF) to the testing problem. It is shown that the FBF does not always function as Occam's razor. Second we develop a new automatic balanced Bayes factor with equal priors for the variances. Third we propose a Bayes factor based on an adjustment of the marginal likelihood in the FBF approach. The latter two methods always function as Occam's razor. Through theoretical considerations and numerical simulations it is shown that the third approach provides strongest evidence in favor of the true hypothesis.},

@article{Verhagen:2016aa,
	abstract = {Abstract When comparing test or questionnaire scores between groups, an important assumption is that the questionnaire or test items are measurement invariant: that they measure the underlying construct in the same way in each group. The main goal of tests for measurement invariance is to establish whether support exists for the null hypothesis of invariance. Bayesian hypothesis testing enables researchers to investigate this null hypothesis, where evidence in favor of invariance is quantified using the Bayes factor. A Bayes factor for the investigation of measurement invariance assumptions of test items for randomly selected groups was developed by Verhagen and Fox (2013a). For specific groups or measurement occasions, a different Bayes factor test is proposed here, which directly evaluates item parameter differences between groups. This test is compared to recently developed frequentist measurement invariance tests based on the Wald test in a simulation study. The close-comparison with the Wald-test performance validates the proposed Bayes factor and shows the advantages of the additional information given by the Bayes factor. Both tests are applied to the investigation of measurement invariance of a geometry test (CBASE) to illustrate the use of the Bayes factor test for measurement invariance.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Bayes factor can be used to break the stalemate between prototype and exemplar theorists in category learning. Exemplar theorists do not accept prototype theorists' results, because these results are often based on a restricted version of the exemplar model, without response scaling parameter. Prototype theorists do not accept exemplar theorists' results, because these results are often based on comparing fits of models that are unbalanced in their number of parameters. Using the Bayes factor alleviates concerns about differences in model complexity between exemplar and prototype models, because it takes away the prototype theorists' fear that their model is disadvantaged, and it eliminates the need to use a constrained version of the exemplar model exemplar theorists have abandoned. Further, by virtue of its sensitivity to the prior, the adoption of the Bayes factor encourages more complete theorizing about the relevant psychological processes instantiated in the models, and increases the empirical content of the models.},

@article{Turner:2016aa,
	abstract = {Abstract Recent advancements in Bayesian modeling have allowed for likelihood-free posterior estimation. Such estimation techniques are crucial to the understanding of simulation-based models, whose likelihood functions may be difficult or even impossible to derive. One particular class of simulation-based models that have not yet benefited from the progression of Bayesian methods is the class of neurologically-plausible models of choice response time, in particular the Leaky, Competing Accumulator (LCA) model and the Feed-Forward Inhibition (FFI) model. These models are unique because their architecture was designed to embody actual neuronal properties such as inhibition, leakage, and competition. Currently, these models have not been formally compared by way of principled statistics such as the Bayes factor. Here, we use a recently developed algorithm--the probability density approximation method--to fit these models to empirical data consisting of a classic speed accuracy trade-off manipulation. Using this approach, we find some discrepancies between an assortment of model fit statistics. For some participants, one model appears to be superior when one fit statistic is used, while another appears superior when a different statistic is used. However, for 13 of the 20 participants, one model wins by all of the fit metrics considered. The FFI wins in 5 of these cases, while the LCA wins, often by a wide margin, for the others.},

@article{Wetzels:2016aa,
	abstract = {Abstract The hot hand phenomenon refers to the popular notion that the performance of sports players is punctuated by streaks of exceptional performance. During these streaks, the player is said to be `hot', or even `on fire'. Unfortunately, when it comes to assessing evidence for the hot hand phenomenon, human intuition is inadequate---people are known to perceive streaks even in sequences that are purely random. Here we develop a new statistical test for the presence of the hot hand phenomenon for binary sequences of successes and failures. The test compares a constant performance model to a hidden Markov model with two states (one representing hot performance, and one representing cold performance) and one probability of switching from one state to the other. We assume appropriately restricted uniform priors on the model parameters and compute the Bayes factor by integrating the likelihood over the prior. The test is assessed in a simulation study and applied to real data sets from basketball and from psychology. Our analysis suggests that it is difficult to find compelling evidence for and against streakiness except for very long data sequences and extreme forms of streakiness.},

Such predictions are a joint function of the likelihood of the model, and the prior distributions placed on the parameters of the model. Prior distributions that are informed by previous data lead to more constrained predictions, and result in Bayes factors that test more specific versions of the models under question. We present a case study applying two models of visual working memory to a series of experiments. We outline a process by which the posterior distributions from previous experiments are used to define and update prior distributions for each subsequent experiment. For each experiment we obtain Bayes factors that test the predictions that these models make, and update our beliefs about the relative likelihood of each model.},

  abstract      = {Objective This study examines the efficacy of incorporating exergaming into physical education (PE) lessons among children and pre-adolescents in influencing the social cognitive factors and behaviors of physical activity (PA), based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Design We conducted a six-week study centered on a 2 (exergaming: \{PE\} lesson with Wii vs. \{PE\} lesson without Wii) × 2 (age group: 10 years-old children vs. 12 years-old pre-adolescents) between-subject factorial design. Method 1112 participants were randomly assigned to the study conditions. At the end of the six-week program, participants completed a survey consisting of measures from the \{TPB\} variables. Results Exergaming significantly influenced \{PA\} attitude, subjective norm, intention, and strenuous exercise behavior, with participants in the Wii-incorporated \{PE\} lesson more likely to emerge with more positive beliefs and behaviors. Age significantly influenced outcome variables, with the effect of exergaming more pronounced among children than pre-adolescents in attitude, moderate and mild exercise behaviors. Conclusions Incorporating exergaming into \{PE\} lessons can be more effective than regular \{PE\} in enhancing \{PA\} beliefs and behaviors, particularly among younger children.},

It is proposed that the Model of Stereotype Threat may serve as a useful theoretical tool for interpreting the situational impact of negative stereotypes on the health intentions of overweight individuals. Analyses with a community sample of 100 clinically overweight women showed that priming overweight women to think about weight-related stereotypes led to significantly diminished exercise and dietary health intentions.},

  abstract      = {Studies in the Proteus Effect (N. Yee \& J. Bailenson, 2007) have shown that the appearance of avatars (i.e., digital representations of ourselves) can lead to behavioral changes in users. For example, participants in attractive avatars became friendlier to confederate strangers than participants in unattractive avatars. While the Proteus Effect is premised on self-perception theory (D. Bem, 1972)---the notion that we infer our own attitudes by observing ourselves as if from a third party---it is also possible that the previous findings were caused by priming (i.e., behavioral assimilation; J. Bargh, M. Chen, \& L. Burrows, 1996). In our study, we used immersive virtual environment technology to experimentally tease apart embodiment from perception of the same visual stimulus. Our results showed that embodiment produced significantly larger behavioral changes than mere observation of the same visual stimuli. These findings support the claim that our avatars provide a unique lever to behavioral change; however, more work is needed to pin down the exact mechanism behind the effect.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Digital games often benefit players, whether in learning, health, or simply entertainment, but some game design elements (e.g., avatars) potentially disadvantage certain social groups (e.g., women). To counteract such potential effects, we explore the moderating role of avatar self-relevance in avatar-induced stereotype threat effects. Specifically, we examine how avatar customization (i.e., designing an avatar) and avatar-body connection (i.e., the perception that the avatar is incorporated into body schema) interact with avatar gender to influence user's post-game behavior in ways that conform to gendered stereotypes. In an experimental study (N = 64, all female), participants completed a competitive math task after playing a digital sword-fighting game. For participants who customized an avatar and experienced low avatar embodiment, those who used male avatar performed better at the math task than those who used a female avatar. These findings extend our understanding of avatar use effects, especially as they relate to avatar self-relevance, avatar customization, avatar embodiment, and stereotype threat, thereby providing insights into the ways that digital games can be designed to maximize positive outcomes for players in a variety of meaningful contexts.},

	abstract = {Two online surveys examined the significance of the visual analogues, or 'avatars', men (total N=266) create and use online. Two-dimensional (adiposityxmuscle) somatomorphic matrices revealed that avatars are generally thinner than their creator's actual body and similar to their ideal, but more muscular than either their actual or ideal. Men's ratings of the importance of their avatar's appearance correlated with their actual weight and muscle concerns, and disparity between their avatar and actual body dimensions predicted their offline context body change concerns additional to that accounted for by disparity between their ideal and actual bodies. Together with the observation that men also reported higher self-esteem, less social interaction anxiety and less social phobia while online (which correlated with the time they spent online), these results suggest that the physical dimensions of avatars used in social interactions online may serve a compensatory function.},

The current study tested whether exercise video games (exergames) can provide unique opportunities for exercise interventions through the use of avatars. An experiment was conducted using a 2 (BID: High vs. Low) × 2 (Exercise context: Solitary vs. Group) between-subjects design. Results demonstrated that individuals with high \{BID\} reported similar or more favorable exergame experiences compared to individuals with low BID. Further, individuals' social physique anxiety was significantly reduced during exergame play. Self-presence mediated the relationship between exercise context and exergame experiences.},

  abstract      = {Eta squared measures the proportion of the total variance in a dependent variable that is associated with the membership of different groups defined by an independent variable. Partial eta squared is a similar measure in which the effects of other independent variables and interactions are partialled out. The development of these measures is described and their characteristics compared. In the past, the two measures have been confused in the research literature, partly because of a labelling error in the output produced by certain versions of the statistical package SPSS. Nowadays, partial eta squared is overwhelmingly cited as a measure of effect size in the educational research literature. Although there are good reasons for this, the interpretation of both measures needs to be undertaken with care. The paper concludes with a summary of the key characteristics of eta squared and partial eta squared.},

	abstract = {Abstract Prior research has shown that approximately 50% of active participants in the 3D virtual world of Second Life have one or more secondary avatars or ``alts'' in addition to their primary avatar. Thus, these individuals are operating a ``multiple or poly-identity system'' composed of a physical self, a primary avatar, and one or more alts. However, little is known about the functions these virtual identities serve for the virtual-world user. The current study involved qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews with Second Life participants (N = 24) who had a primary avatar and at least one alt. Interviews were coded to examine the functions that primary avatars and alts served. Eight functions---seven suggested by previous research on virtual world identity and one that emerged from analyses---were reflected in a large majority of the transcribed interviews and are described in the article. The current findings add to our understanding of how multifaceted identity systems operate, as more individuals augment their physical self with a set of virtual identities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Video games provide extensive player involvement for large numbers of children and adults, and thereby provide a channel for delivering health behavior change experiences and messages in an engaging and entertaining format. METHOD: Twenty-seven articles were identified on 25 video games that promoted health-related behavior change through December 2006. RESULTS: Most of the articles demonstrated positive health-related changes from playing the video games. Variability in what was reported about the games and measures employed precluded systematically relating characteristics of the games to outcomes. Many of these games merged the immersive, attention-maintaining properties of stories and fantasy, the engaging properties of interactivity, and behavior-change technology (e.g., tailored messages, goal setting). Stories in video games allow for modeling, vicarious identifying experiences, and learning a story's ``moral,''among other change possibilities. CONCLUSIONS: Research is needed on the optimal use of game-based stories, fantasy, interactivity, and behavior change technology in promoting health-related behavior change.},

Survey studies were conducted with over 1000 students in Singapore primary and secondary schools. The results of the studies demonstrated that \{PAI\} can be conceptualized and reliably measured in terms of four-factors -- feelings during play, absorption during play, positive attitudes toward the game avatar and importance of the avatar to one's self identity. The four-factor model showed acceptable model data fit and satisfactory reliability and validity. The construct validity was supported by the relationship between \{PAI\} and identity style. The result suggested that students with diffused identity style reported significant higher scores on absorption and importance to identity. The usefulness of the concept and the scale was discussed in relation to behavioral and developmental implications.},

	abstract = {AbstractBackground Gamification is increasingly used as a design strategy when developing behavior change support systems in the healthcare domain. It is commonly agreed that understanding the contextual factors is critical for successful gamification, but systematic analyses of the persuasive contexts have been lacking so far within gamified health intervention studies. Objectives and methods Through a persuasion context analysis of the gamified health behavior change support systems (hBCSSs) literature, we inspect how the contextual factors have been addressed in the prior gamified health BCSS studies. The implications of this study are to provide the practitioners and researchers examples of how to conduct a systematic analysis to help guide the design and research on gamified health BCSSs. The ideas derived from the analysis of the included studies will help identify potential pitfalls and shortcomings in both the research and implementations of gamified health behavior change support systems. Results We systematically analyzed the persuasion contexts of 15 gamified health intervention studies. According to our results, gamified hBCSSs are implemented under different facets of lifestyle change and treatments compliance, and use a multitude of technologies and methods. We present a set of ideas and concepts to help improve endeavors in studying gamified health intervention through comprehensive understanding of the persuasive contextual factors. Conclusions Future research on gamified hBCSSs should systematically compare the different combinations of contextual factors, related theories, chosen gamification strategies, and the study of outcomes to help understand how to achieve the most efficient use of gamification on the different aspects of healthcare. Analyzing the persuasion context is essential to achieve this. With the attained knowledge, those planning health interventions can choose the `tried-and-tested' approaches for each particular situation, rather than develop solutions in an ad-hoc manner.},

@article{Li2016aa,
	abstract = {Abstract While the benefits of physically immersive video games, or exergames, have witnessed much research attention, less is known about the psychosocial processes that enable exergames to be an effective digital tool. An increasing number of exergames feature in-game graphical representations (avatars) of players and, and research shows that these avatars have the potential to influence self-perceptions. This study proposes an exergame motivation model based on the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) that explores the impact of avatars on exergame players. The SCT suggests that individuals can learn through an enactive experience, and exergames appear to offer this form of learning through the presence of the player's in-game graphical representation (self avatar). 322 participants played an exergame for six sessions that feature self avatars. Structural equation modeling (SEM) results showed a good fit for the proposed exergame motivation model. Through the presence and behavior of the player's self avatar, the player learns by experiencing for himself/herself the results and consequences of his/her behavior within the exergame as he/she identifies with the character. Enjoyment was also found to partially mediate the relationship between identification with the avatar and exergame intention. The proposed exergame motivation model is likely to contribute to a deeper understanding of avatar and exergame effects and inform future research on health gaming interventions.},
