	Abstract = {Little is known about the effects of playing sexualizing video games on adolescent boys' and girls' self-objectified body image. Early and middle adolescents (N = 115; M-age = 12.63, SD = 0.85) participated in a between-subjects experiment testing the effect of playing with a sexualized male or female avatar as compared to a control condition. We revealed that playing a video game with a sexualized avatar increased self-objectification among adolescents. This effect occurred regardless of the gender of the adolescent and, thus, did not support the gender congruency hypothesis. In contrast to the activation frequency hypothesis and video game literature on sexualization, the effect of playing with a female sexualized avatar was not moderated by game frequency. Given the adverse consequences of self-objectification in adolescence, the current study results highlight the need for research on how these effects may be countered.},

	Abstract = {Novel avatar bodies are ones that are not controlled in a one-to-one relationship between the user's body and the avatar body, for example, when the avatar's arms are controlled by the user's legs, or, when the avatar has a third arm. People have been shown to complete tasks more successfully when controlling novel avatar bodies than when controlling avatars that conform to the normal human configurations, when those novel avatars are better suited to the task (Won, Bailenson, Lee, \& Lanier, 2015). However, the novel avatars in such studies tend to follow two conventions. First, the novel avatars still resemble biological forms, and second, the novel extensions of the avatar are connected to the avatar body. In the following study, participants operated bodies with three arms. We examined the interaction between biological appearance of the third arm and whether it was attached to the body. There was a significant effect of biological appearance on performance, such that participants inhabiting an avatar with a biological appearance did worse overall. There was also an interaction with biological appearance and an extension that appeared detached from the participant's body such that participants in this condition performed most poorly overall. We propose a relationship between self-reported presence and task success, and discuss the implications of these findings for the design, implementation, and use of novel avatars.},

@article{Jun:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Spatial perception research in the real world and in virtual environments suggests that the body (e.g., hands) plays a role in the perception of the scale of the world. However, little research has closely examined how varying the size of virtual body parts may influence judgments of action capabilities and spatial layout. Here, we questioned whether changing the size of virtual feet would affect judgments of stepping over and estimates of the width of a gap. Participants viewed their disembodied virtual feet as small or large and judged both their ability to step over a gap and the size of gaps shown in the virtual world. Foot size affected both affordance judgments and size estimates such that those with enlarged virtual feet estimated they could step over larger gaps and that the extent of the gap was smaller. Shrunken feet led to the perception of a reduced ability to step over a gap and smaller estimates of width. The results suggest that people use their visually perceived foot size to scale virtual spaces. Regardless of foot size, participants felt that they owned the feet rendered in the virtual world. Seeing disembodied, but motion-tracked, virtual feet affected spatial judgments, suggesting that the presentation of a single tracked body part is sufficient to produce similar effects on perception, as has been observed with the presence of fully co-located virtual self-avatars or other body parts in the past.},

	Abstract = {Research has indicated that many video games and virtual worlds are populated by unrealistic, hypersexualized representations of women, but the effects of using these representations remain understudied. Objectification theory suggests that women's exposure to sexualized media representations leads to self-objectification. Further, we anticipated this process would lead to increases in rape myth acceptance (RMA). Two experiments (Study 1, N = 87; Study 2, N = 81) examined the effects of avatar features on women's experiences of self-objectification. In both studies, college women exposed to sexualized avatars experienced higher levels of self-objectification after the virtual experience than those exposed to nonsexualized avatars. Furthermore, in Study 2, self-objectification mediated the relationship between controlling a sexualized avatar and subsequent levels of RMA. We discuss the implications of women using sexualized avatars in video games and virtual environments, which may lead to negative attitudes about the self and other women off-line due to heightened self-objectification.

@article{Ratan:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Digital games often benefit players, whether in learning, health, or simply entertainment, but some game design elements (e.g., avatars) potentially disadvantage certain social groups (e.g., women). To counteract such potential effects, we explore the moderating role of avatar self-relevance in avatar-induced stereotype threat effects. Specifically, we examine how avatar customization (i.e., designing an avatar) and avatar-body connection (i.e., the perception that the avatar is incorporated into body schema) interact with avatar gender to influence user's post-game behavior in ways that conform to gendered stereotypes. In an experimental study (N = 64, all female), participants completed a competitive math task after playing a digital sword-fighting game. For participants who customized an avatar and experienced low avatar embodiment, those who used male avatar performed better at the math task than those who used a female avatar. These findings extend our understanding of avatar use effects, especially as they relate to avatar self-relevance, avatar customization, avatar embodiment, and stereotype threat, thereby providing insights into the ways that digital games can be designed to maximize positive outcomes for players in a variety of meaningful contexts.

Specifically, the experiment tested if men and women would linguistically assimilate a virtual gender identity intimated by randomly assigned gendered avatars ( either matched or mismatched to their true gender). Results supported the notion that gender-matched avatars increase the likelihood of gender-typical language use, whereas gender-mismatched avatars promoted countertypical language, especially among women. The gender of a partner's avatar, however, did not influence participants' language. Results generally comport with self-categorization theory's gender salience explanation of gender-based language use.},

	Abstract = {An important challenge today is to support creativity while enabling geographically distant people to work together. In line with the componential theory of creativity, self-perception theory and recent research on the Proteus Effect, we investigate how avatars, which are virtual representations of the self, may be a medium for stimulating creativity. For this purpose, we conducted two studies with a population of engineering students. In the first study, 114 participants responded to online surveys in order to identify what a creative avatar may look like. This enabled us to select avatars representing inventors, which were perceived as creative by engineering students, and neutral avatars. In the second study, 54 participants brainstormed in groups of 3, in 3 different conditions: in a control face-to-face situation, in a virtual environment while embodying neutral avatars and in a virtual environment with inventor avatars. The results show that inventor avatars led to higher performance in fluency and originality of ideas. Moreover, this benefit proved to endure over time since participants allocated to inventor avatars also performed better in a subsequent face-to-face brainstorming. The prospects of using avatars for enhancing creativity-relevant processes are discussed in terms of theoretical and applicative implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The study extends research on the Proteus effect by demonstrating that avatars can prime negative attitudes and cognition in desktop virtual settings. Experiment 1 shows that, after virtual group discussions, participants using black-cloaked avatars developed more aggressive intentions and attitudes but less group cohesion than those using white-cloaked avatars. In Experiment 2, individual participants using a Ku Klux Klan (KKK)-associated avatar created more aggressive Thematic Apperception Test stories in comparison to a control group. Participants using the KKK avatar also wrote less affiliative stories in comparison to those employing avatars dressed as doctors. Overall, the resulting pattern of activation of negative thoughts (i.e., aggression) coupled with the inhibition of inconsistent thoughts (i.e., cohesion, affiliation) is consistent with principles of current priming models and provides initial evidence for automatic cognitive priming in virtual settings.},

	Abstract = {The tendency to discount larger future benefits in favor of smaller immediate gains (i.e., temporal discounting) is relevant to the issue of obesity. Successful weight loss requires individuals to sacrifice immediate culinary pleasures in favor of future health gains. Based on the notion that increasing the vividness of one's future self may mitigate temporal discounting and promote the ability to delay gratification, we examined whether viewing one's weight-reduced self (i.e., the ideal self) in a virtual environment can decrease temporal discounting and lead to better regulation of dietary practices. Seventy-six undergraduates who had reported an intention to lose weight were recruited to participate in a laboratory experiment and were randomly assigned to interact with either the weight-reduced self (experimental condition) or the present self (control condition) by looking into a dressing mirror in a virtual fitting room. A temporal-discounting task and a taste test were subsequently administered. Results showed that, compared with control participants, participants who viewed their weight-reduced avatars ate less ice cream in a taste test and were more likely to choose a sugar-free drink as a reward. The discounting rate mediated the association between the avatar manipulation and the amount of ice cream eaten in the subsequent taste test. Overall, our findings suggest that a computer-generated image of one's weight-reduced self may assist in resisting impulses that promote immediate gratification over delayed benefits. This research provides a new approach for controlling impulsive behavior such as dietary regulation and weight control.},

	Abstract = {The perpetuation of unrealistic body ideals by popular media has been linked to negative body image and self-esteem; however, the influence of video games has remained largely unexamined despite their growing popularity as a media form, particularly among men. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether playing video games that emphasize an unrealistic male body ideal has a negative impact on body satisfaction. Participants played a highly realistic video game for 45 min and then completed questionnaires measuring muscularity concerns and body image. Men randomized to the experimental group played the game with a character of exaggerated muscularity, whereas those randomized to the control group played with a character of average build. Men in the muscular condition reported significantly lower body satisfaction than men in the control condition. Considering the wide-spread use of video games, as well as the increasing muscularity of the ideal male body in popular culture, this finding could have important implications for the psychological well-being of men who regularly play video games. Further research should assess whether this lowered body satisfaction is maintained and to determine if negative behavioral consequences emerge. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {We derived competing hypotheses from the gender similarities perspective versus the gender differences perspective to examine participants' behavior in an online virtual world in which we manipulated participants' gender. To manipulate participants' gender in the virtual environment, we randomly assigned them to one of three avatars (female, male, or robot). Using a screen recording device, we measured the percentage of time participants spent interacting with empathizing (e.g., options for shopping, telephone) and systemizing (e.g., weapons, options for building) objects in a virtual reality house that we constructed to reflect evidence put forth by the differences perspective. Because we derived competing hypotheses we expected to find support for either the similarities perspective or the differences perspective; however, our results suggested support for both. Consistent with the differences perspective hypotheses, participants paid attention to objects in the environment that were consistent with the social representation of their own gender. However, our results were consistent with the similarities perspective hypotheses, such that the avatars' gender also played a role in the percentage of time participants spent interacting with empathizing and systemizing objects. Therefore, we conclude that observable differences between men and women are the consequence of both biological and social forces, and research should focus on the interaction between the two as etiologies and explanations for sex and gender differences and similarities.

	Abstract = {Introduction: Body image disturbance is considered a pervasive issue among women and is a core feature of eating disorders. Previous research provides evidence of the ability of body ownership illusions in virtual reality to produce changes in one's own body representation, especially in body size estimation. However, less information is available about changes in subjective body attitudes. This study assesses whether owning a female virtual avatar with different body sizes produces changes in body image distortion and body image dissatisfaction in women. Method: Forty female college students were exposed to an immersive virtual environment, in which they were sequentially embodied in three avatars using synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation. The first and third avatar had the same body size as the participant, but the second one had a larger body size. In the larger avatar condition, the group was divided into two: 20 participants owned a virtual body 20{\%} larger and the other twenty a virtual body 40{\%} larger. Body image distortion and body image dissatisfaction were assessed before and after embodiment in each of the three avatars using a silhouette test. Results: Mixed between-within analyses of variance showed a statistically significant effect of the variable Time (four assessment points) on body image distortion (F (3, 38)=2.825, p=.042, eta 2=0.069) and body image dissatisfaction (F (3, 38)=6.933, p<.001, eta 2= 0.154). The effect of the variable Group (20{\%} increase versus 40{\%} increase in the larger body size avatar) and the interaction between time and group were not statistically significant. Overall, participants reported a reduction in the body image overestimation after owning the same-size avatar for the second time (M=8.88, SD=12.48) than at the other assessment points (at pre-test: M=13.00, SD=17.09; after owning the first same-size virtual body: M=13.75, SD=11.14; and the larger size avatar: M=14.50, SD=15.18). In regards to body image dissatisfaction, the highest levels were recorded at pre-test (M=16.38, SD=18.54) and after owning the larger size avatar (M=15.50, SD=19.57) and lowest levels after owning the same-size avatar for the second time (M=6.88, SD=13.85). More interestingly, the reduction in body dissatisfaction after owning the same-size avatar for the second time compared with pre-test was statistically significant (F (1, 38) =18.098, p<.001, eta 2=0.323). Conclusion: This study extends the evidence available about the ability of full virtual body ownership illusions to modify the mental representation of one's own body. Owning a virtual body with different body sizes produces changes not only in size overestimation but also in body dissatisfaction; and, most importantly, inducing the ownership illusion of a larger-size virtual body reduces body dissatisfaction when subjects return to the same-size avatar, probably due to a comparison effect.},

This study examines how interacting avatars' age affects older adult's self-disclosure and trust in a relation-building context. Previous studies have found that users can take on behaviors consistent with characteristics of the avatars. In social interactions, people also assess their avatar in relation to other avatars for similarity or differences. We conducted a 2 (self-avatar: old vs. young)x2 (other's avatar: old vs. young) experiment with older-adult participants aged 60+ (n=95). The findings show that using younger avatars did not increase self-disclosure. However, the older-adult participants disclosed more information when their avatar's age matched their partner avatar's age (i.e., old to old, young to young). They also trust their partners more when the interacting avatars shared similar age. This study provides theoretical insights into the role of avatars in online relationship-building and extends our understanding of the avatar effects on older adults.},

	Abstract = {We experience virtual worlds as avatars-we dress, move, engage in activities or interact with other users as avatars. Recent studies suggest that embodying an avatar does not only influence users' behavior in a virtual environment, but it can also change users' behavior in reality. However, little has been known about the role of an avatar's appearance in changing users' behavior through embodying the avatar. We investigated how an online game avatar's body shape (obese vs. normal weight) and health behavior (healthy behavior vs. unhealthy behavior) can affect users' health behavior after their virtual experience. Specifically, we conducted a laboratory experiment, and assigned participants to either an obese or a normal-weight avatar in a game. Half of the participants' avatars performed healthy behaviors (engaged in physical activities and vegetable consumption), and the other half of participants performed unhealthy behaviors (engaged in sedentary behavior and binge-eating). After 20-min gameplay, participants were offered a box with high-sugar cookies, and also asked to use an exercising machine. According to the results, the normal avatar's healthy behavior increased participants' exercising behavior (use of the exercising machine). However, the obese avatar's healthy behavior did not. Additional analyses revealed that using an avatar with an unhealthy lifestyle predicted male participants' consumption of high-sugar cookies. The avatar's body shape alone did not independently predict neither participants' exercising behavior nor cookie consumption. Theoretical and practical implications for the use of virtual environments to increase users' health behavior were discussed.},

	Abstract = {Although it has been shown that immersive virtual reality (IVR) can be used to induce illusions of ownership over a virtual body (VB), information on whether this changes implicit interpersonal attitudes is meager. Here we demonstrate that embodiment of light-skinned participants in a dark-skinned VB significantly reduced implicit racial bias against dark-skinned people, in contrast to embodiment in light-skinned, purple-skinned or with no VB. 60 females participated in this between-groups experiment, with a VB substituting their own, with full-body visuomotor synchrony, reflected also in a-virtual mirror. A racial Implicit Association Test (IAT) was administered at least three days prior to the experiment, and immediately after the IVR exposure. The change from pre- to post-experience IAT scores suggests that the dark-skinned embodied condition decreased implicit racial bias more than the other conditions. Thus, embodiment may change negative interpersonal attitudes and thus represent a powerful tool for exploring such fundamental psychological and societal phenomena. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

	Abstract = {Background: Recent studies have shown that playing prosocial video games leads to greater subsequent prosocial behavior in the real world. However, immersive virtual reality allows people to occupy avatars that are different from them in a perceptually realistic manner. We examine how occupying an avatar with the superhero ability to fly increases helping behavior.        Principal Findings: Using a two-by-two design, participants were either given the power of flight (their arm movements were tracked to control their flight akin to Superman's flying ability) or rode as a passenger in a helicopter, and were assigned one of two tasks, either to help find a missing diabetic child in need of insulin or to tour a virtual city. Participants in the "super-flight" conditions helped the experimenter pick up spilled pens after their virtual experience significantly more than those who were virtual passengers in a helicopter.        Conclusion: The results indicate that having the "superpower" of flight leads to greater helping behavior in the real world, regardless of how participants used that power. A possible mechanism for this result is that having the power of flight primed concepts and prototypes associated with superheroes (e.g., Superman). This research illustrates the potential of using experiences in virtual reality technology to increase prosocial behavior in the physical world.},

The aim of this study was to investigate these two processes in a crossed design, in order to examine their interaction in the context of a brainstorming task. To activate the Proteus effect, we used creative avatars resembling inventors, and to make social identity salient, we made the avatars wear the traditional clothing of the participants' school. The resulting factorial design included four conditions: creative avatars with or without social identity cues, and non-creative avatars with or without social identity cues. The results show that creative performance was higher with creative than non-creative avatars, but only in the absence of social identity cues. Furthermore, the presence of social identity cues increased social identification to the group, but this unexpectedly decreased creative performance. This result is discussed together with an analysis of the meaning of the social identity cues we used, which appeared to be unrelated to creativity. This discussion highlights that the effects of social identity cues on performance are complex and may be moderated by their meaning and the particular facet of social identity they make salient.},

The current study investigates the extent bias behavior transfers into social interactions in virtual worlds by investigating the effect of aversive racism on helping behaviors and learning within a virtual world for medical triage training. In a 2 x 2 x 2 mixed design, two between subjects variables, participant skin tone (light, dark) and avatar skin tone (light, dark), and one within subjects variable, agent skin tone (light, dark), were manipulated. Effects on helping behaviors were observed on three measures: time to initiate help, errors made while helping virtual patients, and learning. Participants, regardless of their skin tone or their avatar's skin tone, took more time to initiate help and made more errors while triaging dark-skinned agents in comparison to light-skinned agents. The bias against virtual patients with a darker skin tone also served as a mediating factor for learning with lower prior knowledge increasing the errors made for dark skinned virtual patients, which had more of a negative impact on learning than the errors made on light skin virtual patients. This study showed that participants applied general biases against dark-skinned agents regardless of participant's ethnicity or avatar's skin-tone. It indicates the importance of considering biases when designing training systems.},

In a between-subjects design, 300U.S. college students either played or watched someone else play a videogame as either a sexualized or non-sexualized female avatar under high (memorize 7 symbols) or low (memorize 2 symbols) cognitive load. Hypotheses were derived from the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP) and perspectives on stereotype processing. Results contradicted hypotheses that greater task demands and sexualization would produce greater RMA, hostile sexism, and self-objectification. Instead, we found that sexualization did not affect these variables. Greater cognitive load reduced rape myth acceptance and hostile sexism for those in the sexualized avatar condition, but it did not affect self-objectification. We discuss these results with respect to the LC4MP and suggest that the processing of stereotype-inconsistent information might be the underlying cause of these unexpected findings. These results provide tentative evidence that cognitively demanding video game environments may prompt players to focus on stereotype-inconsistent, rather than stereotype-consistent, social information.},

	Abstract = {When an individual embodies an avatar, the latter's characteristics or stereotype can change the individual's behavior and attitudes; this is known as the Proteus effect. Here, we looked at whether the embodiment of an avatar resembling an elderly adult (seen from a first-person perspective and facing a virtual mirror) changed mentally represented physical activity in a motor imagery task performed by young adult participants (N = 52). To ensure that the impact of embodiment of an elderly avatar on the motor imagery task was not influenced by a potentially confounded stereotype assimilation effect (due to the mere presence of an avatar), a ``young''avatar and an ``elderly''avatar were always present together in the virtual environment--even though only one (the self-avatar) was embodied at a given time. We found that it took longer for the participants to perform the motor imagery task with the elderly self-avatar than with the young self-avatar. The more negative the participant's beliefs about motor activity in the elderly, the greater the observed effect of the avatar on motor imagery performance. We conclude that knowledge about the characteristics of an embodied avatar can modify the subject's level of mentally represented physical activity. {\copyright}2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	Abstract = {A psychological phenomenon termed "stereotype threat" has been shown to contribute to women's underperformance and underrepresentation in math and science fields. Within the virtual reality literature, a recent study utilized gendered body-swap illusions (i.e., women in male virtual bodies) to mitigate the effects of stereotype threat among a sample of female participants. The present research provides a much needed replication of this intervention, as well as a critical extension of virtual reality research on the Proteus Effect to test whether stereotype threat can be induced among male participants immersed in a female virtual body. Results supported both the replication and extension hypotheses; female participants embodied in male avatars were buffered from stereotype threat whereas male participants embodied in female avatars suffered from stereotype threat. Avatar gender also influenced participants' math confidence and awareness of the negative societal stereotype regarding women's math ability. {\copyright}2020 ACM.},

	Abstract = {When immersive virtual reality users employ digital self-representations, i.e., avatars, they may be subject to the Proteus effect. This effect describes changes in attitudes and behaviors in accordance with identity cues derived from the employed avatar's appearance, which can persist after leaving virtual reality. Individual reactions to the experience can affect the strength of observed Proteus effects. Especially the experienced illusions of body ownership of avatars and of being in the virtual environment (spatial presence) have been discussed in this context. This study investigated a Proteus effect of avatar age on post-embodiment walking speed, with special focus on how body ownership and spatial presence moderated this effect. Participants who had previously embodied older avatars took significantly longer to walk a set distance than either young avatar or control group participants. This was only apparent during the first half of the walking phase, which may indicate fast decay rates of the effect after embodiment ended. The reported body ownership could not be shown to impact the strength of the Proteus effect. Participants reporting more pronounced spatial presence were subject to stronger Proteus effects, with only the two-thirds of the sample with higher spatial presence showing evidence of the effect. {\copyright}2019, {\copyright}2019 The Author(s).

We conducted a within-subjects study to investigate the potential of transformed embodied experiences on users' emotional states. We assigned participants to embody three generic avatars that moved in ways that evoked positive and negative emotional states. Each avatar followed the participant's tracked movements, but these movements were transformed to present exaggeratedly open, closed or neutral postures.

	Abstract = {Women in math, science, and engineering (MSE) often face stereotype threat: they fear that their performance in MSE will confirm an existing negative stereotype - that women are bad at math - which in turn may impair their learning and performance in math. This research investigated if sexist nonverbal behavior of a male instructor could activate stereotype threat among women in a virtual classroom. In addition, the research examined if learners' avatar representation in virtual reality altered this nonverbal process. Specifically, a 2 (avatar gender: female vs. male) ×2 (instructor behavior: dominant sexist vs. nondominant or nonsexist) between-subjects experiment was used. Data from 76 female college students demonstrated that participants learned less and performed worse when interacting with a sexist male instructor compared with a nonsexist instructor in a virtual classroom. Participants learned and performed equally well when represented by female and male avatars. Our findings extend previous research in physical learning settings, suggesting that dominant-sexist behaviors may give rise to stereotype threat and undermine women's learning outcomes in virtual classrooms. Implications for gender achievement gaps and stereotype threat are discussed. {\copyright}Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.},

	Abstract = {This study presents the second phase of a series of experiments investigating the impact of avatar visual fidelity on the sense of embodiment and users' behavior in immersive virtual environments. Our main focus concerns the similarity between users and avatars, a factor known as truthfulness. Our experiment requires the participants to control three avatars using a third-person perspective: a robot, a suit and their virtual doppelganger (virtual representation of the self). In order to analyze users' reactions and strategies, each task of the scenario of the virtual reality application can potentially affect the integrity of their characters. Our results revealed that ownership, one of the three factors of the sense of embodiment, is higher for the participants controlling their self-representation than with abstract representations. Furthermore, avatar visual fidelity seems to affect users' subjective experience, half of the panel reported having different behavior depending on the controlled character. Abstract representations allow the users to adopt more risky behaviors, while self-representations maintain a connection with the real world and encourage users to preserve the integrity of their avatar. {\copyright}2019 Gorisse, Christmann, Houzangbe and Richir.},

In this simulation, half embodied an avatar of Kim Kardashian, a celebrity known for her narcissistic behavior and materialistic purchases, while the other half embodied a generic female avatar of similar appearance. Participants then chose between luxury and nonluxury brands for a variety of objects. Results indicated that participants did not take on the luxury purchase behaviors of Kim Kardashian and in fact showed lower narcissism scores after embodying her than those embodying a generic avatar.

	Abstract = {The underrepresentation of women in technical and STEM fields is a well-known problem, and stereotype threatening situations have been linked to the inability to recruit and retain women into these fields. Virtual reality enables the unique ability to perform body-swap illusions, and research has shown that these illusions can change participant behavior. Characteristically people take on the traits of the avatar they are embodying. We hypothesized that female participants embodying male avatars when a stereotype threat was made salient would demonstrate stereotype lift. We tested our hypothesis through a between-participants user study in an immersive virtual environment by measuring working memory. Our results support that stereotype threat can be induced in an immersive virtual environment, and that stereotype lift is possible with fully-immersive body-swap illusions. Additionally, our results suggest that participants in a gender-swapped avatar without an induced stereotype threat have significantly impaired working memory; however, this impairment is lifted when a threat is made salient. We discuss possible theories as to why a body-swap illusion from a female participant into a male avatar would only increase working memory impairment when not under threat, as well as applications and future research directions. Our results offer additional insight into understanding the cognitive effects of body-swap illusions, and provide evidence that virtual reality may be an applicable tool for decreasing the gender gap in technology. {\copyright}2018 IEEE Computer Society.

	Abstract = {Despite relatively equal participation rates between females and males in casual gaming, females often report stigmatisation and prejudice towards their gaming competency within this sub-domain. Applying the theoretical framework of ``stereotype threat'', this research examined the influence of explicit stereotype priming on females' casual gameplay performance and related attitudes. It also investigated whether the gender of the game avatar heightens susceptibility to stereotype threat. One hundred and twenty females were allocated randomly to one of four experimental conditions in a 2 (Condition: Stereotype threat, Control) x 2 (Avatar gender: Feminine, Masculine) between-subjects design. They completed a short gaming task and measures of social identity, competence beliefs, gameplay self-efficacy and self-esteem. Findings indicate that priming explicitly a negative gender-related stereotype did not appear to have a significant detrimental impact on gameplay performance or gameplay-related attitudes. Additionally, gameplay performance was not affected significantly by manipulating the gender of the gaming avatar. These findings suggest that, although females appear to be knowledgeable about negative gender-gaming stereotypes, these might not impact performance. Moreover, females tend not to endorse these beliefs as a true reflection of their gaming ability, representing a positive finding in view of the prevailing negative attitudes they face in gaming domains. {\copyright}2017 Elsevier Ltd},

@article{Verhulst:2018aa,
	Abstract = {Research in Virtual Reality (VR) showed that embodiment can influence participants' perceptions and behavior when embodied in a different yet plausible virtual body. In this paper, we study the changes an obese virtual body has on products perception (e.g., taste, etc.) and purchase behavior (e.g., number purchased) in an immersive virtual retail store. Participants (of a normal BMI on average) were embodied in a normal (N) or an obese (OB) virtual body and were asked to buy and evaluate food products in the immersive virtual store. Based on stereotypes that are classically associated with obese people, we expected that the group embodied in obese avatars would show a more unhealthy diet, (i.e., buy more food products and also buy more products with high energy intake, or saturated fat) and would rate unhealthy food as being tastier and healthier than participants embodied in "normal weight" avatars. Our participants also rated the perception of their virtual body: the OB group perceived their virtual body as significantly heavier and older. They also rated their sense of embodiment and presence within the immersive virtual store. These measures did not show any significant difference between groups. Finally, we asked them to rate different food products in terms of tastiness, healthiness, sustainability and price. The only difference we noticed is that participants embodied in an obese avatar (OB group) rated the coke as being significantly tastier and the apple as being significantly healthier. Nevertheless, while we hypothesized that participants embodied in a virtual body with obesity would show differences in their shopping patterns (e.g., more "unhealthy" products bought) there were no significant differences between the groups. Stereotype activation failed for our participants embodied in obese avatars, who did not exhibit a shopping behavior following the (negative) stereotypes related to obese people. conversely, while the opposite hypothesis (participants embodied in obese avatars would buy significantly more healthy products in order to "transform" their virtual bodies) could have been made, it was not the case either. We discuss these results and propose hypotheses as to why the behavior of the manipulated group differed from the one we expected. Indeed, unlike previous research, our participants were embodied in virtual avatars which differed greatly from their real bodies. Obese avatars should not only modify users' visual characteristics such as hair or skin color, etc. We hypothesize that an obese virtual body may require some other non-visual stimulus, e.g., the sensation of the extra weight or the change in body size. This main difference could then explain why we did not notice any important modification on participants' behavior and perceptions of food products. We also hypothesize that the absence of stereotype activation and thus of statistical difference between our N and OB groups might be due to higher-level cognitive processes involved while purchasing food products. Indeed our participants might have rejected their virtual bodies when performing the shopping task, while the embodiment and presence ratings did not show significant differences, and purchased products based on their real (non-obese) bodies. This could mean that stereotype activation is more complex that previously thought. {\copyright}2018 Verhulst, Normand, Lombart, Sugimoto and Moreau.},

	Abstract = {Creative ideation can be enhanced in 3D virtual environments by manipulating the appearance of a user's avatar so that it primes a creative stereotype. However, not much is known about the factors that influence the effectiveness of using avatars to enhance creativity. In this study we investigate experimentally whether the degree to which users identify with their avatar moderates their actual ability to generate creative ideas. The results suggest that a non-creative avatar (office worker stereotype) diminishes creativity, but our creative avatar (artist stereotype) does not augment creativity. The similarity in appearance between the user and its avatar positively moderates, whereas its perceived embodiment with the avatar negatively moderates the ability to generate creative ideas. However, the study also suggests that self-similarity might be an even more effective way to support creative ideation than priming creative stereotypes. Therefore, this study (i) contributes that self-similarity and embodiment moderate the effectiveness of using an avatar to prime creative stereotypes to enhance creative ideation, and (ii) points toward a novel way to enhance creative ideation in virtual environments, by using avatars that look just like yourself. {\copyright}2017 ACM.},

This phenomenon is called the Proteus effect. In the research concerning the Proteus effect, researches on the behavior change have been actively conducted. However, the difference between the self-perception changed by the Proteus Effect and the physical sense in real world has not been sufficiently discussed. Therefore, in this research, we prepared two different kinds of avatars with different appearances, and investigated the influence of the change of self-perception changed for each avatar on the evaluation of physical sensation. As a result, a significant difference in the evaluation of weight between the two conditions was found. It was clarified that the Proteus effect affects the evaluation of physical sensation. {\copyright}Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

This article, ``The Effects of Avatar Stereotypes and Cognitive Load on Virtual Interpersonal Attraction: Mediation Effects of Perceived Trust and Reversed Perceptions Under Cognitive Load,''by Jorge Pe{\~n}a and Seung-Chul Yoo, was first submitted to Communication Research on July 11, 2012 and accepted for publication on April 4, 2014. Subsequently, on May 30, 2014, Jorge Pe{\~n}a and Seung-Chul Yoo published an article that is based on the same experiment and data set as the abovementioned article in Presence, titled ``Under Pressure: Avatar Appearance and Cognitive Load Effects on Attitudes, Trustworthiness, Bidding, and Interpersonal Distance in a Virtual Store''(doi:10.1162/PRES{\_}a{\_}00166). The Pe{\~n}a and Yoo articles in Presence and Communication Research are highly redundant in their contribution. We, the editors of Communication Research, have examined the two articles and conferred with the corresponding contributor, Dr. Pe{\~n}a, on the matter. The two pieces utilize different dependent variables that are, however, extremely similar. They are nearly identical in their findings and present substantially overlapping material. Because the findings in the two articles could have easily been presented in one publication, we see this as a case of fragmented (``piecemeal''or ``salami'') publication. Drawing on the guidance on publication ethics from various academic associations and the Committee on Publication Ethics, we consider the article in Communication Research a covert redundant publication; the authors failed to acknowledge any other articles reporting data from the same data set in their initial correspondence with the journal editorial office or through a citation in the manuscript. Dr. Pe{\~n}a suggested that Dr. Yoo should be explicitly exculpated from the matter because Dr. Yoo was a graduate student at the time of submission. Dr. Pe{\~n}a wishes to bear the entire responsibility for this matter. We have contacted the editors of Presence to inform them of this redundant publication. {\copyright}The Author(s) 2014.},

	Abstract = {Virtual environments employing avatars for self-representation - including the opportunity to represent or misrepresent social categories - raise interesting and intriguing questions as to how one's avatar-based social category shapes social identity dynamics, particularly when stereotypes prevalent in the offline world apply to the social categories visually represented by avatars. The present experiment investigated how social category representation via avatars (i.e., graphical representations of people in computer-mediated environments) affects stereotype-relevant task performance. In particular, building on and extending the Proteus effect model, we explored whether and how stereotype lift (i.e., a performance boost caused by the awareness of a domain-specific negative stereotype associated with outgroup members) occurred in virtual group settings in which avatar-based gender representation was arbitrary. Female and male participants (N=120) were randomly assigned either a female avatar or a male avatar through a process masked as a random drawing. They were then placed in a numerical minority status with respect to virtual gender - as the only virtual female (male) in a computer-mediated triad with two opposite-gendered avatars - and performed a mental arithmetic task either competitively or cooperatively. The data revealed that participants who were arbitrarily represented by a male avatar and competed against two ostensible female avatars showed strongest performance compared to others on the arithmetic task. This pattern occurred regardless of participants' actual gender, pointing to a virtual stereotype lift effect. Additional mediation tests showed that task motivation partially mediated the effect. Theoretical and practical implications for social identity dynamics in avatar-based virtual environments are discussed. {\copyright}Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Objective: Exercise-based videogames, or exergames, provide a promising and novel way to improve exercise attitudes and behavior among overweight children. These digital interventions often allow for customizations of player characters and weave in narratives and goals. Theoretically, the presence of visual identity cues (e.g., avatars) and social category cues (e.g., stereotypes) within the virtual gaming environment are likely to motivate a player's exercise attitudes and behavior in various ways. This study examined the effects of both visual cues (via the Proteus effect) and social cues (via stereotype threat) on overweight children's exercise attitudes and game performance in a virtual running game. Subjects and Methods: A 2 (avatar body size: Normal versus overweight)×2 (stereotype threat: Present versus absent) factorial design experiment was conducted with 140 overweight children between 9 to 12 years of age. Dependent variables measured were participants' exercise attitudes, exercise motivation, exercise motivation with regard to the Nintendo{\textregistered}(Kyoto, Japan) Wii{\texttrademark}, and their in-game performance. Results: Multivariate analysis of covariance tests showed that overweight children assigned to avatars of normal body size scored significantly better on all four variables compared with those assigned to avatars of large body size, whereas overweight children assigned to a stereotype threat absent condition scored significantly better on three of the four variables compared with those assigned to a stereotype threat present condition. Conclusions: Using avatars with normal body size and not being subjected to stereotypical messages has the potential to increase the effectiveness of exergames among overweight children. Exergame developers should consider designing avatars that are slim and toned and set "weight neutral" goals and challenges. These may provide more motivation and yield greater attitudinal and behavioral changes among overweight children. {\copyright}Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.},

	Abstract = {Informed by the Proteus effect, the current study examined the moderating effect of belief in stereotypes on the relationship between avatar appearance and user behavior, via an interactive fiction. The results of a one-factor (avatar gender: male vs. female), between-subjects experiment revealed that female avatars elicited more frequent masculine behaviors (particularly among individuals high in feminine gender stereotypes) and that male avatars elicited more frequent feminine behaviors. Conversely, self-reported gender led to stereotypic behaviors as expected. A moderating effect of awareness of the avatar's influence on stereotypically gender-based decisions on frequency of gender-typed behavior was not found, suggesting individuals are not aware of the influence of avatars on their subsequent decisions. {\copyright}2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This research tested the effects of playing a violent game as a Black (vs. White) avatar on racial stereotypes and aggression. In Experiment 1, White participants (N = 126) who played a violent video game as a Black avatar displayed stronger implicit and explicit negative attitudes toward Blacks than did participants who played a violent video game as a White avatar or a nonviolent game as a Black or White avatar. In Experiment 2, White participants (N = 141) who played a violent video game as a Black (vs. White) avatar displayed stronger implicit attitudes linking Blacks to weapons. Implicit attitudes, in turn, related to subsequent aggression. Black violent video game avatars not only make players more aggressive than do White avatars, they also reinforce stereotypes that Blacks are violent. {\copyright}The Author(s) 2014.},

	Abstract = {Previous research has shown that violent video games can increase aggression in players immediately after they play. The present research examines the effects of one subtle cue within violent video games that might moderate these effects-whether the avatar is male or female. One common stereotype is that males are more aggressive than females. Thus, playing a violent video game as a male avatar, compared to a female avatar, should be more likely to prime aggressive thoughts and inclinations in players and lead to more aggressive behavior afterwards. Male and female university students (N=242) were randomly assigned to play a violent video game as a male or female avatar. After gameplay, participants gave an ostensible partner who hated spicy food hot sauce to eat. The amount of hot sauce given was used to measure aggression. Consistent with priming theory, results showed that both male and female participants who played a violent game as a male avatar behaved more aggressively afterwards than those who played as female avatar. The priming effects of the male avatar were somewhat stronger for male participants than for female participants, suggesting that male participants identified more with the male avatar than did the female participants. These results are particularly noteworthy because they are consistent with another recent experiment showing that playing a violent game as an avatar with a different stereotypically aggressive attribute (black skin color) stimulates more aggression than playing as an avatar without the stereotypically aggressive attribute (Yang et al., 2014, Social Psychological and Personality Science). {\copyright}2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The Proteus effect proposed by Yee and Bailenson (2007) suggests that embodiment may lead to shifts in self-perception both online and offline based on the avatar's features or behaviors. A 2 ×2 experiment, the first of its kind, examined how self-perception and attitudes changed after women (N = 86) entered a fully immersive virtual environment and embodied sexualized or nonsexualized avatars which featured either the participant's face or the face of an unknown other. Findings supported the Proteus effect. Participants who wore sexualized avatars internalized the avatar's appearance and self-objectified, reporting more body-related thoughts than those wearing nonsexualized avatars. Participants who saw their own faces, particularly on sexualized avatars, expressed more rape myth acceptance than those in other conditions. Implications for both online and offline consequences of using sexualized avatars are discussed. {\copyright}2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Bailenson, 2007) have shown that the appearance of avatars (i.e., digital representations of ourselves) can lead to behavioral changes in users. For example, participants in attractive avatars became friendlier to confederate strangers than participants in unattractive avatars. While the Proteus Effect is premised on self-perception theory (D. Bem, 1972)-the notion that we infer our own attitudes by observing ourselves as if from a third party-it is also possible that the previous findings were caused by priming (i.e., behavioral assimilation; J. Bargh, M. Chen, \& L. Burrows, 1996). In our study, we used immersive virtual environment technology to experimentally tease apart embodiment from perception of the same visual stimulus. Our results showed that embodiment produced significantly larger behavioral changes than mere observation of the same visual stimuli. These findings support the claim that our avatars provide a unique lever to behavioral change; however, more work is needed to pin down the exact mechanism behind the effect. {\copyright}Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

More important, studies have shown that people infer their expected behaviors and attitudes from observing their avatar's appearance, a phenomenon known as the Proteus effect. For example, users given taller avatars negotiated more aggressively than users given shorter avatars. Two studies are reported here that extend our understanding of this effect. The first study extends the work beyond laboratory settings to an actual online community. It was found that both the height and attractiveness of an avatar in an online game were significant predictors of the player's performance. In the second study, it was found that the behavioral changes stemming from the virtual environment transferred to subsequent face-to-face interactions. Participants were placed in an immersive virtual environment and were given either shorter or taller avatars. They then interacted with a confederate for about 15 minutes. In addition to causing a behavioral difference within the virtual environment, the authors found that participants given taller avatars negotiated more aggressively in subsequent face-to-face interactions than participants given shorter avatars. Together, these two studies show that our virtual bodies can change how we interact with others in actual avatar-based online communities as well as in subsequent face-to-face interactions. {\copyright}2009 Sage Publications.},

Unlike a human, it can be expected that the bird avatar can leads to give psychological effects in a flight experience, because a bird has flight ability.

On the basis of the Persona method and the Proteus effect, we design avatars' appearance so as to implement a Need-seeker or a Technology-driver innovation strategy. To test the effectiveness of this avatar-mediated innovation tool, we conducted an experiment in a French company. Two groups of highly qualified employees from the innovation department had to find applications for smart windows in public transportation. Both groups experienced immersion in a virtual transportation situation: one group embodied avatars resembling Inventors, whereas the other group embodied Personas representing users of public transportation. As expected, avatars' appearance proved to influence the creative production: the Inventor condition led to a techno-centered ideation profile, oriented toward technological solutions, while the Persona condition led to more user-centered, needs-oriented ideas. Consistently, Inventors' production tended to be better evaluated through industrial criteria and Personas' production tended to be better evaluated by transportation users.

These results, their theoretical implications, and future directions are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Whether sexualization of female characters in video games impacts women players'body satisfaction and aggression toward other women remains an issue of debate. In the current study, female players were randomly assigned to play either a more or less sexualized avatar in a Tomb Raider game. Participants also reported on their self-objectification and body dissatisfaction, as well as hostility and aggression toward a female confederate. Results indicated that exposure to a sexualized avatar in a video game did not influence any outcomes for female participants. These results indicate that, at least for video games, exposure to sexualized females may not have a substantial impact on female players. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved); Public Policy Relevance Statement---Many individuals are worried that sexualization in video games may increase female players'body dissatisfaction. Contrary to expectations, results from the current study did not find that sexualization increased body dissatisfaction or aggression toward other women. Media influences from video games appear to be minimal. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

	Abstract = {Within the framework of social cognitive theories and current models of media priming, two experiments tested hypotheses regarding video game playing, implicit stereotyping, and a behavioral manifestation of aggression. In these two experiments, race and gender of the video game characters played served as a media prime that was expected to affect the players' attitudes and behavior. In Experiment 1, playing a violent male (as opposed to a violent female) avatar led to a stronger implicit association of males with violence and directly primed aggressive behavior. No significant relation was found between the activation of the implicit gender-violence association and aggressive behavior. In Experiment 2, playing a violent Black (as opposed to a violent White) avatar led to a stronger implicit association of Blacks with violence and directly primed aggressive behavior. A significant relation was found between the activation of the implicit race-violence association and aggressive behavior. Furthermore, mediation analysis showed that implicit racial stereotyping significantly mediated the effect of racial priming induced by playing a violent Black avatar on subsequent aggression. These results provide unique insight into the media priming literature by demonstrating experimental evidence for the cognitive mechanisms underlying media priming effects. More specifically, the implicit associations prompted by a media prime were shown to be actually translated into the behavior indicative of that activated stereotype. Implications for stereotyping processes and aggressive outcomes are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	Abstract = {Past research provides evidence that embodying a racially stereotyped African American video game character triggers stereotyped thinking among White players. However, the mechanisms through which virtual racial embodiment of a negatively stereotyped character in a video game impacts stereotyped thinking are still unknown. This study expands on past research and utilizes a between-subjects experimental design to test two possible theoretical explanations: the virtual threat effect and presence. On the one hand, embodying a negatively stereotyped African American character may elicit stereotyped thinking among White players due to the mere exposure to the threatening stereotype. According to this explanation, negative affective response to the threatening stimulus predicts stereotyping. On the other hand, the process of embodying, not just observing, the stereotyped African American character suggests that presence in the game may determine how impactful the game imagery is on White players'stereotyping of African Americans. In this case, level of presence would predict stereotyping. The findings of this study advance research by providing evidence of a psychological explanation for the negative effects of embodying a racially stereotyped video game character on players'race-related perceptions. We conceptualize the 'virtual threat effect,' which may be applied in additional contexts to understand how embodying stereotyped representations of outgroups in virtual environments may negatively affect individuals'perceptions and support of these groups.

Bussey and Bandura's (1999) social cognitive theory of gender development and differentiation was used to explicate this relationship. Undergraduate students (N = 328) at a large U.S. Southwestern university participated in the study. Students were randomly assigned to play a 'sexualized' heroine, a 'non-sexualized' heroine, or no video game; then completed an online questionnaire. Female self-efficacy was negatively affected by game play with the sexualized female character. Results cautiously suggest that playing a sexualized video game heroine unfavorably influenced people's beliefs about women in the real world.

	Abstract = {Objective: Prior research has documented favorable effects of active and educational videogames among adolescents. However, research on potential negative effects of such games is limited. Scholars have called attention to games portraying sexualized female characters. The purpose of the current study was to experimentally investigate the effect of playing a videogame with a sexualized female character on adolescents'acceptance of rape myths and tolerance for sexual harassment. Materials and Methods: Fifty-seven secondary school pupils, 12--15 years of age, participated in a 2 (gender: boys versus girls) ×2 (game character: nonsexualized versus sexualized female) factorial design experiment. Participants played a game for 15 minutes and were randomly assigned to one of the two game characters. Afterward, they completed established scales to assess rape myth acceptance and tolerance for sexual harassment. Results: Analyses of variance showed greater acceptance of rape myths (P = 0.039) and greater tolerance of sexual harassment (P = 0.046) in adolescents who played with the sexualized woman compared with adolescents in the control condition. We did not find significant differences between boys and girls or any interaction effect between gender and game character. Conclusions: Findings suggest that gameplaying with a sexualized woman may increase adolescents'acceptance of rape myths and tolerance for sexual harassment. These findings highlight attention to the use of sexualized female game characters in (educational and active) videogames that target adolescents.

	Abstract = {Content analyses indicate that women and girls are gender-stereotyped and negatively portrayed in video games, yet, to date, no research has examined the effects of exposure to these images on consumers. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of sexualized (stereotypical) and non-sexualized (counter-stereotypical) portrayals of female characters in video games on players' self-esteem, gender stereotyping, body esteem, self-objectification, and self-efficacy. Social cognitive theory and presence are utilized to explicate the processes through which individuals are affected by video game play. According to social cognitive theory, the portrayals of women and girls in video games would be expected to influence social perceptions about gender and self-concept in both male and female users. Integrating presence into this theoretical framework aids in explaining the effects of exposure to this uniquely interactive medium. The findings from this study suggest that short-term exposure to a sexualized female video game character predicts lower self-efficacy and negative attitudes toward women in terms of their physical capabilities for female players. Additionally, level of presence experienced by male game players predicted body-related outcomes, such that a higher level of presence was related to greater body satisfaction and lower self-objectification in men. Presence had no significant effect on the relationship between sex, type of character played, and the outcome variables. The results of this study are of consequence not only to media effects researchers but also to parents, legislators, and video game programmers.

	Abstract = {Computer-mediated communication (CMC) technology provides users with increasingly detailed means of presenting themselves to those that they interact with. As more users begin to incorporate these technologies into their lives, there is an increased need for research concerning the effects of this type of self-presentation on an individual's identity. This study seeks to expand on previous research on Identity Shift, in which self-presentation of specific traits in CMC environments have been shown to result in changes to one's self-concept concerning those traits. The analysis utilizes Hyperpersonal Theory and the Proteus Effect to construct and test a theoretical model of the Identity Shift process, including the potential for avatar use to influence effects. It is predicted that when self-presentations are constructed in public CMC contexts, and involve visual cues through the construction of an avatar, participants will experience more Identity Shift than when their self-presentation is in a private CMC context, and/or does not involve visual cues through the construction of an avatar. Results of this analysis indicate that avatars do not influence the Identity Shift process in the predicted way. In addition, while self-presentations perceived as public did result in more Identity Shift than those that were perceived as private, this relationship was heavily influenced by several other variables. Overall the findings of this study point to a very complex relationship between the CMC user and their audience. This was highlighted by the fact that degree of difficulty with the task and pre-test personality traits not only had an impact on Identity Shift, but also influenced how public participants felt when using CMC. While feeling public did increase Identity Shift, the nature of 'feeling public' online appears to be more complex than simply being in a public setting. This analysis points to specific circumstances in which Identity Shift is increased for online communicators. This can provide important insights for those attempting to understand the manner in which computer users are affected by the technologies they employ. Moreover, attempts made to harness Identity Shift for therapeutic purposes can benefit from a more in-depth look at how to maximize these effects.

	Abstract = {Whether sexualization of female characters in video games impacts women players'body satisfaction and aggression toward other women remains an issue of debate. In the current study, female players were randomly assigned to play either a more or less sexualized avatar in a Tomb Raider game. Participants also reported on their self-objectification and body dissatisfaction, as well as hostility and aggression toward a female confederate. Results indicated that exposure to a sexualized avatar in a video game did not influence any outcomes for female participants. These results indicate that, at least for video games, exposure to sexualized females may not have a substantial impact on female players. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved); Public Policy Relevance Statement---Many individuals are worried that sexualization in video games may increase female players'body dissatisfaction. Contrary to expectations, results from the current study did not find that sexualization increased body dissatisfaction or aggression toward other women. Media influences from video games appear to be minimal. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

	Abstract = {A virtual avatar is a video game player's self-presentation in virtual space. The physical appearance of an avatar can prime stereotypes and behavioral scripts stored in memory. The relation between avatar appearance and aggression has been substantially confirmed, but there are open questions about the conditions in which this association is strongest, and what the relation between avatar identification and aggression is. This study used a cue-priming paradigm in two experiments to test the effect of avatar appearance on avatar identification and aggression in violent and nonviolent video games; to test gender as a moderator of these effects; and to test the correlation between avatar identification and aggression. The first experiment investigated the effect of avatar appearance on the level of avatar identification and aggression in violent and nonviolent video games. This experiment employed a 2 (Avatar Appearance: justice/evil) ×2 (Game Violence: violent/non-violent) between-subjects design. 75 male participants were randomly assigned to play a violent or non-violent video game using an avatar representing justice or evil. Based on the first experiment, the second experiment explored the interaction effect of avatar appearance and gender on the level of avatar identification and aggression in a violent video game. This experiment also employed a 2 (Avatar Appearance: justice/evil) ×2 (Gender: male/female) between- subjects design. 42 male and 36 female participants were randomly assigned to play a violent video game using an avatar representing justice or evil. After game play, the amount of hot sauce given by participants to an ostensible partner who hated spicy food was used to measure aggression, and an avatar identification scale was used to measure identification with the avatar. The results showed that: (1) The relations between avatar appearance, avatar identification and aggression were influenced by the violence of game. In the violent video game, the identification with the justice avatar was significantly higher than with the evil avatar, and the evil avatar elicited significantly higher aggression than the justice avatar. In the non-violent game, there was a marginally significant difference between the identification with the justice or evil avatar, but there was no significant difference between the level of aggression elicited by the justice or evil avatar. (2) In the violent video game, the avatar effects were moderated by player gender. Specifically, the avatar identification of female participants was significantly affected by avatar appearance, whereas that of the male participant was not. Avatar appearance had a stronger impact on the aggression of males than females. (3) There was a significant correlation between avatar identification and aggression, which was moderated by game violence and gender. In conclusion, the results of this study supported the priming effect theory and were partially consistent with the existing research. Several factors influenced the effect of avatar appearance on aggression, including a video game factor (violent or non-violent game) as well as an individual factor (male or female), and the complex relationship between avatar identification and aggression. One social implication of the study is that game designers should embed more positive associations, situations, and stereotypes in games to provide users more positive potential priming effects.

	Abstract = {Virtual environments enable people to experience extraordinary identities or circumstances. People can take on superhero or super-villain roles using digital avatars in virtual space. By acting as these avatars, individuals may learn new behaviors and model their own, real-life behaviors after them (Bandura, 1977; Bem, 1972). The virtual environment is, thus, a vehicle for observation, imitation, and modeling; players'avatars may fuel these processes. Recent empirical research confirms that the behavior of players'avatars can affect players'self-concepts, cognitions, and feelings (Gentile et al., 2009; Greitemeyer \& Osswald, 2010). Thus, concepts related to avatar behaviors in general (e.g., fighting against evil) or to particular avatars (e.g., Superman) may affect subsequent behavior (e.g., good deeds). Identification with an avatar is correlated with avatar-consistent behavior in the real world (Rosenberg, Baughman, \& Bailenson, 2013). In the experiments reported here, we investigated whether certain types of avatars and avatars'behaviors could promote pro- or antisocial actions in everyday behavior.

@article{Yee:2007abprotm,
	Abstract = {Digital media allows us to make both dramatic and subtle changes to our self-representations with an ease not available elsewhere. These changes can greatly affect how we socially interact with others in virtual environments. For example, facial and behavioral mimicry can make us more likeable and persuasive. In addition to gaining social advantages, our avatars (digital representations of ourselves) can also change how we behave in social contexts. This occurs via conforming to expected behaviors of the avatar - a process referred to as the Proteus Effect. I conducted a series of four pilot studies that explore the Proteus Effect. In the first study, I found that participants in attractive avatars walked closer to and disclosed more information to a stranger than participants in unattractive avatars. In the second study, I found that participants in taller avatars negotiated more aggressively in a bargaining task than participants in shorter avatars. In the third study, I demonstrated that the Proteus Effect occurs in an actual online community. And in the final study, I showed that the Proteus Effect persists outside of the virtual environment. Placing someone in a taller avatar changes how they consequently negotiate in a face-to-face setting. The two dissertation studies extended these pilot studies by attempting to clarify the underlying process that leads to the Proteus Effect. In the first dissertation study, I isolated and teased out the unique contribution of the Proteus Effect from an alternative explanation - priming. Priming is a process whereby visual stimulus (such as words or photographs) leads someone to behave in a semantically-consistent manner. In the second dissertation study, I extrapolated from existing theories of stereotype formation to examine the consequences of placing users in implausible bodies that fall outside the range of normal human variation (such as a very short or very tall body).
